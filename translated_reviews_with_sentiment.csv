"I personally chose Intel Core i7 (12700K) with built UHD graphics for my newly built desktop PC. For those, who don't want to use a separate and usually exorbitantly prized graphics cards, this processor is a very good alternative. It can handle most of the processing intensively render of Blender easily with its unblocked overlocking (obviously you have to use the support table, i.e. presentable UHD graphics for my newly built PC. For those, who don't want to use a separate graphics card, this is a very good alternative.",positive
"I have spent this processor with Ass Prime Z690A motherboard and 32G 5200Mhz DDR5 ram. My use is mostly for Adobe suite for 4K video rendering & photoediting (without dedicated eGPU) and occasional AAA title playing like GTA5, Battlefield, Cpunk, etc. The processor works like a charm for rendering and Games up to 75Hz in 1080p plus setting. Above all good processor for the price and more review to come in future editions.",positive

"So, being an AMD fanboy, I was not on getting this, but the c/t (current to threads) kinda caught my eye. Running 12 colours, and 20 threads (4 e-cores i think) I thought, well, for the price, it should be okay? I was wrong... This cpu is a monster in my eyes. Running with 32GB of ram (dr4) and matched with the RTX 4070 GPU being cooled by the Art Liquid Freezer ii, there is nothing stopping this from performance to its max. I would recommend this part of kit to anyone, starting out or continuing on with building computers for their ""high end"" gaming etc. I have not once seen this stroke.",positive
This is what is expected of its specifications.,negative
"At the time I bought it I wondered if I would get very badly treated, since it was imported from Amazon USA, but it was in excellent condition, they did with delivery time and had absolutely no problem in shipping or delivery, as well as that it is at a price lower than the rest. I strongly recommend it, especially for people like me who are arming their first PC Gamer and work and looking for piece by piece.",positive
"It's very fast, but completely forgotten, it comes to use 220W in stress test. Before buying, find out about the forums on this issue, it doesn't matter which cooler and thermal pasta use, it's going to forget very much. The only solution is to make a slight undervoltage, or reduce loadline calibration in the BIOS. It reminded me of the i7-7700K that suffers from the same problem.",negative
"As with Intel it is very good, the perfects are just incredible with the native boost, I have managed to get the OC up to 5.2Ghz and I am convinced that we can still mount with a custom water. The default is that when we take a 4080 it takes a little bit of language in 4k. I'm going to have to change it after 2 years because of bottleneck, but on a config with a 3080(ti) it has to be a very nice synergy. Very good on processor tasks too, to use it to make some perfect performance really good.",positive
"I have been using AMD since I was a youth and started building computers. The conclusion is: It is an amazing CPU, runs faster than my Ryzen 7700. The price AND performance AMD was better than if I had gone with a Ryzen 7800X. Some backend information: I have never ordered a Amazon home.",positive

"This is my first Intel building coming from past AMD buildings (Ryzen, FX, Athlon, Phenom). I am nowhere near a hardware engineer level to distinguish or feel the differences in performances but for the average gamer and tournament on this CPU with instructions followed, this chip is very well to be worthy and trusted to be future test until at least 2026. I overclockd this via the motherboard/bios settings and it stays cool with a $30 fan cooler. (don't get a super cap or small cpu cooler otherwise would be delegated) Just follow installation instructions mostly the chip is delicate. Windows experience this is a 9.7 so that says it has the extra 50-60-$ lose its share.",positive

"I graduated from the i7 6700k to the i3 13100 and saw a great performance increase. I was ageing to test ddr5. However, I also wanted to experiment with 6+ core processors. Fortunately I found this i7 12700k when the price dropped to 275. I wasn't sure if it would be a big increase from the i3 and the I7 6700k. But the i7 12700k is a huge beast that has crossed all tasks I've given it and brought home life back to my RTX 2060 super super and it's stay cool & flunt.

"A very good product. I take it for software development and the truth is very fast the computer, even when I docker.",positive
"Finally a good step forward by Intel. The processor will be really good, park in consumption, powerful in both single and in many Koreas and does not get too hot. If you are looking at it you will probably already have seen countless benchmarks on the web so it is useless to post them. Like all components of a PC will be challenged compared to the use that a person has to do. Personally I advise you to buy it.",positive

The turbo at a little more than 5Ghz is rigolo, but it doubles the conso and then the temperature. It goes well but this heats hard when it activates the turbo, and if you're trying to fan the least point you understand!",positive
"A great performance, get enough for the performance it gives. I got this for 210 dollars on BF. Recommended!",positive
"High quality product, planned to purchase for configuration of a new PC Very satisfied on purchase and delivery times",positive
"No problem with mounting: I set up a NHU12A noctual ventirade: when the proc works at 100%, it remains below 80°C. In normal operation, the whole is silent. Be careful if the CM goes to DDR5: it is 2 times the price of DDR5. The GPU works well (treating video) while the graphics cards return to reasonable prices.",positive
"At this time in the product life cycle, the 12th gene CPU is about half the cost of the 14th gene CPU. It is more than fast enough for everything I do. My major reason for upgrading was my old motherboard did not have TPM 2.0. The CPU was easy to install, it is running between 36-37 degrees Celsius (though I admit I am not stressing it).",positive
Good enough for this price range,positive

Great product/Brand Intel i7 CPU. I have been using the Intel brand CPUs and have been using the i7 and the K series since they were introduced. This looks like to handle video processing and CAD/CAM projects quit well. I have always had great luck with Intel brand processors and will continue using them. Pretty good value for the cost.,positive
Huge upgrade from 8th gene i5! paired it with the ASRock Z690 and 32g DDR4,positive
"Compared to the Coffee Lake generation I had been (willingly) stuck on for 4 years this is a massive leaf. Before buying I was a bit skeptical since I'm not a fan of Intel's new way of action courses, but the first thing I tried when I got it was emulating PS3 games and right off the bat I saw complementary times cut at least doubled. The old CPUs from the 8th, 9th, and 10th gene are perfectly usable for most people so if you're on a budget maybe look on the used market for those. But if you really need something powerful this is a good option.",positive

"This item has been with me for a very short time. So I recently decided to upgrade my gambling wealth, and after extensive research, I made the Bold choice to order the Intel Core i7-12700K Gaming Desktop Processor with Integrated Graphics and 12 Colors. Let me tell you, this processor is the absolute best! With its 12 colours, it brings a whole new level of performance to my gaming experience. Both I'm playing graphically demanding AA titles or pardoning in intensive multitasking, this processor tries to do it all. And what's even better is that it comes with integrated graphics, meaning I didn't have to have extra cash for separate graphics card and 12 colours, and it brings a complete",positive

I received the product as soon as possible. I sealed it and in a box with another product. The operation is good and is not usually very hot with a good cooling system by air.,positive
This appears to be the best option for intelligence at this price range. Works as advertised.,positive
"The one I bought one year ago had instability. Didn't know it was the CPU until it really started acting up. had to do a lot of tests with different component to finally be able to pinpoint the CPU. When I arrived out to Intel, they informed me about a policy about 'tray' processor and 'boxed' processor. basically a Tray processor is paid in bulk and they don't cover warranty. As for Boxed processor, they are paid by some company and cost usually more. Fortunately, the one I got a boxed one, but still Intel told me had a 'tray' processor.",positive
"This is a very good product, and there are no issues with its features and performance. The use process is also very smooth, and there haven't been any overestimating so far.",positive
It's a top-of-the-line CPU that will last for a long time. There's nothing to distinguish about it. it replaced a 12 year 3770K!,negative

"Great CPU for multitasking, I don't know much about CPU but this is great!",positive
"It's pretty good value for money (as far as Intel CPUs are concerned...) for a 12th generation CPU, but if you're looking for the BETTER value get the i5-13600K what superforms it at pretty much the same cost while being a 13th gene CPU. The only real downside of the 13600k is that it generally requires a 13th compatible motherboard, otherwise you need to FLASH THE BIOS on a 12th generation to be able to read 13th not recommended gene CPU (I highly do not recommend this). I've tried it and it's looking a big hassle (many potential issues) that I recommend first time PC builders and share a",positive
"So far so good, but then that's what I said about the last one... I'll check back in a year on this and hope it wastes my primary CPU. As for the last one... it's Intel dropping the ball with their QC it seems. Had an IMC function poorly and finally give up the host and refuse to post with more than one memory module installed. Couldn't run any XMP profiles, and swap the processor solved it (not a Mobo issue). Just watch for funky possessor when you buy this gene, and return it if *nothing*s even *remotely* off.",positive
"Not much to say about this cpu. It's Intel, and these are immortal. Still have the 3770K I got like 10 years ago, and an Extreme I got even earlier than that. So the main reason here is to let Amazon know that I HAVE received the item, but I don't know how to let them know so they can change the ""package left at mail"" to "" Already received""...",negative

"This thing is a workshop! Ive got mine clocked to 5.0GHz and it runs like a dream, keep in mind this unit will require a water pump on coolers are not enough!",neutral
"Got this K to have graphs backup. The CPU is great the graphics not so much. Still I do not use the internal graphics as primary graphics for my PC, but only for the future of having temporary backup when needed. So for that future it works. The cost vs the KF is very unlikely so for its primary setup it is a very good CPU.",positive
"Buy this for a new personal PC. My last was an i7 4790K built that got totaled out (crushed) during shipping. After building a new one on a z790i platform, the performance gained was tuning, completely night and day! I cannot say enough about this CPU, and would completely recommend this product!!",positive
"The i7-12700K is in the top 5 for playing CPUs right now. AMD is doing fair as of late but Intel has a single core performance on new generation chips. If you're on the fun and want a quick top 5 for all gambling performances, it goes as follows: 1. i9-13700k 3. i9-13600k 5. i7-12700k This chip is no slot though, it's actually overclocking but not fair for comparison. In conclusion, you're looking around this CPU and the 13600k.",positive
"It's been roughly 6-7 years since I last built my gambling computer. Upgrading to this has been more important. As of this writing, I hope you've done your research the I7-12700k's price point and its competition. For this price point, it may be the top dog. Some things to consider before cleaning: 1) Make sure you are cleaning a LGA 1700 motherboard. I went with the DDR4 motherboard because DDR5 is still at its right now. The DDR5 ram may not be the best option for your bug now. You'll be fine with DDR4. 2) This CPU works more power compared to its predecessor.",positive

It runs much cooler than my i9-9,900k (mold OC) (59C-63C under a gambling load vs 75C+) but that could have been due to my old AIO being in it's death through the past few months. 3DMark CPU score went up noticeably as well. Everywhere, I'm pretty happy with it. Haven't been around with it, but there doesn't seem to be as much headroom as there used to be, from what I've read 5.3 Ghz is about you can get out of 800 GHz.",positive

As for gambling, it'll run many older games at a high FPS even without any help from a GPU, and it handles modern titles without any problem, too.

"If you're looking at this as a gambling-only processor, you'll probably get 95% of the gambling performance this offer with the buyer and cooler i5-13600k. Like your money and put it into a better GPU over buying this because that will actually result in more FPS where this processor (over the 13600k) will not. That being said, this processor is a monster. It's a bear to keep cool but it has the performance to back it up.

I have always thought Intel's drivers are better, I also have heard recent reports that Ryzen CPU use can randomly go up by 20% with just the epic games store run. I can imagine this will be fixed as it sounds like some dodge code than the hardware itself. On every game I have played, I don't think the CPU use has gone over 40%. So this CPU will definitely last a LONG time before I upgrade. The 11th generation CPUs will be able to produce up to 20% of the epic store.",positive

If you're not speed-chasing, it's worth the extra money going to the 10900K. If you're overclocking, I personally believe the money-performance ratio is the 10700K on top. But, speed-chasing would pick up the 10900K. As expected, time is a little hotlocking. I spent up to 5.1Hz and left voltage on adaptives.",positive

My intention in getting this chip is to ""future test"" my chip as much as possible. I got from a 2500K chip, so I want to last, I really regret not having got the 2600K (8 logic colours) at the time that would have last me more than the 2500K, and I've kept it pretty much longer than the 2500K.",positive

I have been a computer Enthusiast for a while. I have had several different platforms including both AMD and INTEL. I graduated from a 7700k. The 7700k's 4 colours and 8 threads started to show its age with the latest push for higher core accounts. I discussed getting an AMD 3300x.

People told me I wouldn't see many winning from Ryzen but in some of my favorite games I was getting 60%+ higher frames. Games perform amazingly well and I notice my loading screens all seem more than 20% faster than my old chip as well. Everything is just bigger and faster, there's less waiting time, and I didn't have any bios issues or anything at all.",positive

I bought this to upgrade my gambling PC and without even running a gambling app I can already tell the speed is much better than my i7-6700k. Things that would require 50% of my processor use take less than 10% on my cpu load.

It has no problem action all my desktop apps, it's very responsive. PC power consumption at the plug is around 24W idle with screens on and 10Gb Ethernet card, and the fans are tired. My previous SFF PC had a X470 and Ryzen CPU. I had tons of problems with USB compatibility and the power consumption was higher. I still have a Ryzen in my homelab server, and for that's great, but I think Intel still hold the lead for low power and compatibility.",positive
I was shocked to see how much performance this CPU can get you for such a low price. I did a Budget PC Build 10 months ago and was shocked to see such a high clock for that price.

This feels stronger than any other processor I have used in the past and I can feel the difference using even mid-tier business grade laptops search as a Lenovo I have for work with a Russian 5 for which feel noticeable slower on my laptop (I know is not the same) but itss the only thing I can compare it to. I have used it for light gambling and the works great (With a graphics card of course) integrated graphics searches lol.,positive
"I got this at $115. It's basically just an i7-7700 with slightly less cache. It won't even exceed the 65w TDP limit. It will turbo to 4.1ghz all-core all the time. You won't find a better CPU currently around $100. AMD has nothing that exists in reality due to supply issues. Next step up is the i5-10400F for 50 more at $165.

I would definitely buy this again.",positive
"For light gambling and a low building, it's perfectly fine. Integrated graphics aren't bad and really surprised me now. I've run Hello, Rocket League, Fortnite, and a couple more on low settings without issue. Doesn't get too hot during heavy use either. The included cooler is a big plus, and is super easy to install, just pop some tabs in. I've had it running for a month now with no issues.",positive
This has 25% more speed on my old CPU and works fine for light video production and running Virtual machines... with on board graphics it saved buying an extra card.

Great processor was not expecting the performance from a 4 core/8 thread running at 3.6G. Rated 4 stars because of packaging.

Great processor for low to mid end gambling and on a budget. Best for 1080p gambling on medium to high settings for most games when paired with something like a GTX 1060 Got it for a good price with the federal options as more than likely you need a motherboard to go with it.

I use this CPU in conjunction with an RX6650XT and play Far Cry 6 (Oltra Settings ) with 100 FPS. The CPU is extremely sprassam. A super fast combination.,positive

I build her system with 16GB of DDR4 3600 ram, and an RX 6600 for the GPU, and she has no problem running anything else gambling or productivity. I don't recommend going as hard as you can on the motherboard, if you get this though. The performance on this can be great but you have to get supporting hardware to maximize it.",positive
"The CPU has more than enough power for all office applications and will never be handy in normal operation. A perfect technology at a cost. The installation in a suitable Mainboard (LGA 1700) is easy and is idiotensic. For the i3-12100F, a dedicated graphics card is needed. In the wester model i3-12100, a good graphics solution already exists on the chip and is available for virtually all office work. For ""normal users"", the 20.30 Euro multi-price for the i3-12100 is well established and is already paid for the current calculation.",positive
"I bought this processor to set up a game PC for my son and I am very pleased. A quality-price report is hard to beat. The processor in this version (f) does not have a graphics chip. So it needs to buy a separate graphics card. This I3 12100f has only four hearts and eight threads, which can limit its performance in more serious tasks such as video performance or high-level game. It does not take overlocking, which means that you cannot increase the CPU's clock speed beyond its base specifications.

My system currently runs the Zorin OS (Linux) smoothly and efficiently with temperatures some below 30 degrees.

Taking your average cooler is about $10, you can't really go against an 84-dollar cpu capable of 500+ fps on minicraft, 300+fps on value, etc. I will say though, a quad core cpu in 2023 is a bit problematic, since you'll have extra issues streaming and recording games.

It plays GTA 5, satisfaction, far cry 6, city skilines, and it can even play UEBS 2 with 4 million A.I. enemies. I've only ever seen this hit 100% on benchmarks. Just because it's an i3, don't think it's weak. 12th i3's are more powerful than i7's of older generations. Don't buy the i5, i7, or i9. This processor is still going strong and can still play modern games. Runs sounds of the forest like never hitting 100%.",positive
The price this little quad core comes in at really is incredible. Sure it's quad core but this is not the i3 of the past but you know what I mean. 4.3ghz single core with 8 threads means this think is a mini gambling beast. It can do 1440p gambling (with capable card of course) and I have been doing just that. The only reason I will be moving on from it is for the 6 core i3 in 14th gene.

Just a heads up to anyone who plans to pair 13900k with 4090, don't be a smart and try to put it in small case, you will regret it later. I personally recommended big case with high flow like fractal design between size atx but if you don't want to spend too much money on graphics card and happiness with something else you get with",positive

EXCELECTION OF THE PRODUCT,neutral
"This thing puts enough heat out to a thermal generator, and I really am not cooking. Water cooling ONLY unless you want to melt your board or destroy the high dollar part. I would also recommend a large radiator all, 3 of cover. This thing is an excellent space",positive
"I bought two of these from Amazon after one from another vendor failed to POST. Both worked the first time. Do you need 24 colors for games? Most games use 4 or 6 colours max, so likely not. Video editing can benefit from the extra colors. Intel support XMP (extreme memory profile) and this processor is unlocked. Overclock increases the power consumption and heat; there, one needs a robust cooling solution. Overclock can empty your currency which is strange since Intel Allows and even promotes overclocking with the Intel Extreme Tuning Utility. I have the NZXT Kraken x 73 RGB liquid cooler. With the NZXT and CAM",negative
"It is an excellent processor. It is a beast in gambling and in productivity, for the price I believe is unrivaled. Be careful that you should separately buy a CPU Cooler because it does not come with one. Also keep that most Motherboards moderns put no restrictions to this processor in the BIOS, so they let the draw unlimited power and that comes a very hot temperature limit. For example I'm using an 360mm AIO cooler and with the stock parentboard settings of my AORUS ELITE AX when running it reaches 100°C within 12 seconds of starting. Of course this temperature is only seen in stress tests and never during games (there, the max I've seen the CPU gets 67°C but is relative to some extent.",positive
Run smooth and cool. Great value,positive
"Probably more than I need for gambling, maybe I should have got a 13700k instead of running a little cooler. This gets HOT on my Dark Rock Pro 4. I want to get a 360mm AIO to help cool this.",positive
Very good,positive
"If it has the money to save and want a processor that'll last you at least 5 years (and are a power user like I am) itss a good choice. But most people say the advantages over the 13700k aren't worth it most. If you're just using the PC as a high-end gambling rich and i7-13700k is more than enough than a 4090 GPU. This processor is designed to benefit more advanced users so I'd save the 150$ and get the earner 13700k. Also this processor is notoriously hot, so a safe night on cooler or preferably a 280mm+ watercooler AIO is necessary (especially for overclocking).",positive
It works as intended.,neutral
"If you go with an AIO get a 360mm cooler. I tried using a 240mm and it was just enough to cool the CPU during some Starfield. That out of the way, this thing is seriously impressive. Even with how and optimised some of these new games are, I have never seen anything use it more than 80% other than some CPU specific tasks.",positive

I resset the OS, still issues, I do a fresh clean install, still issues. I try replacing the memory, still issues. I try to install 11 with a different boot installer, still issues.

"The 12900k can be hard to justify. The 12700k is around two-thirds the cost and the difference in performance is only a few percent. Forwardmore, you can get away with a moderate cooling solution on the 12700k where the 12900k really requires a top of the line cooler which will also set you back. Even while using the NH-D15 CPU cooler I decided to subclock the 12900k a little bit in order to keep thermals in check, bringing the performance closer to the 12700k. Give the option to do over, I would just have gone with a $12700k and save myself about $250.",positive
This CPU is power hungry under load but in games the CPU is strong. This also works fine for work station jobs but this Shines in gambling for sure. So if you have the cooling this CPU can be clocked even higher for better performance. But for this you will need a decent CPU cooler.,positive
Great price easy to install,positive
"I've put together a few systems and run some detail 12900k chips so far and the 12900k is by far an amazingly fast CPU. Unfortunately, I ordered from Amazon came already. As soon as I opened the shipping box I could have opened it before.",negative
Good,positive
"Now has a thin film about it. Don't know how it gets electricity and signal from the socket on the motherboard, probably similar to wireless charging, but at least it protects the pins so less likely to damage them while the CPU works during the building. After all CPU is the most or second versus costly component in a PC build. Other than that, the increase in core count and speed, pair with gene 4 SSD and RTX 3090 ti, everything else is just slow",negative
"Received at least a week earlier than the scheduled assessment for delivery. Not installed yet if you look at video reviews I'm sure you know this processor is going to preform when you need it as a creator. At the moment I'm still using a 2010 year, i7 that contained the test of time in a properly built computer. Now it's time for the i9 12900K LGA1700 creator built computer to handle photography & video production in 2022.",positive
"This unit is powerful for all of your needs. Just remember this thing runs really hot!!! Make sure you use a good cooling system. Otherwise, you will have thermal shaking issues.",positive
I bought this thinking it came with the whole case and everything but it came in a cheap little box that was half crossed.,positive
This is the closest processor I've ever owned and with it I upgraded my entire PC. Even though I Purchased last years model it's still extremely fast and works well. Make sure you pair this with a good motherboard otherwise it can run pretty hot.,positive

"Ace from the nightmar Ager Lake is with ram clocking, this thing does everything you need to. Constantly hits 5.1 - 5.2ghz when needed. Don't listen to the AMD fans who try to skip this chip for its heating. I literally just have a 240mm AIO and it doesn't go over 78° and when gambling never even touched 70°. Just do 5 seconds of research on a half decent air cooler or AIO and you're fine with time",positive

Thanks for coming fast and good performance,positive
I found this on sale for $350. A 12th gene i9 for a comparable price to an i7 I mean the review wrote itself couldn't have been more excited to get such a great cpu for such a competitive price.,positive
Awesome Cpu blizzing fast!!!!!!! for gambling and other tasks. i see that the time for this cpu work up to the 70's and even higher 80 + my recommendation is to subvote your cpu if you just gambling that will last time. With good thermal paste Kingpin cooling KPX and a water cooler in getting 55-58c in gambling hope it helps.,positive
"Power, speed, great performance... really a great miracle what this processor does.",positive
The processor is amazing. Upgraded from an Intel 8700k. Paired it with 6400 mz DDR5 memory on an AsRock z690 Taichi motherboard and my Nvidia EVGA 3080Ti and I'm consistently in the top 5% of benchmarks world-wide with barely any doubts except selecting the XMP profile in my bios.,positive

"There's nothing more to say, if you only want to gambling get an i7, unless you're into emulation that's the only instance where you'll get an current edition It runs pretty hot as it takes over 250 watts if it can, in my case over 270 so keep that in mind",positive
"I spent 10 years working with Xeon, and I have to make it clear that they have been excellent and durable processors, but I needed to update a processor that was faster and I've made the right decision with this i9. I work in general design, video editing, animation and 3D, where there is a benefit thanks to its power, everything moves like a mantequila.",positive
This was a huge upgrade to my system for good price. Back to the modern PC world. Win 11 runs great,positive
"The processor is excellent and its performance is only desired. If you doubt one of the best processors at present. However, the maximum load is difficult to refrigerate and has very high energy consumption, but in the rest of the applications consumption is often very low and keeps good temperatures.",positive
This thing is really impressive. It also comes in a very thin gold container. It makes you happy the moment you open the package. As far as I have researched this is the absolute best and most powerful processor on the market as or 9/6/2022. I definitely recommended.,positive
"I love this processor, it can handle anything I throw at it. The only thing I was concerned with is that I bought it 'new', but the stickers were paid off the Intel 12900k box, so I am not sure what was up with that, it looked like it still had the safety seal on it though, but at least it works.",positive
"It will deal all your multiplication needs with ease, even while gambling. Only with me I can think of is that it does run very hot so you'll need a high end cooler to get the best performance",positive
"I Did install it on ASUS ROG Maximum Z690 Formula(WiFi 6E)LGA1700, the motherboard is already high price unworthy money & CPU is overpriced, but it has great performance everywhere, Thanks to the seller is trusted!",positive
"It is a point of balance between performance and temperature, prefer 12th over 13th for a perfect temperature performance and consumption for current times, in summary a great purchase",positive
"I'm very satisfied with this processor, I've used Intel for many years now and I've never had any problems with them. Looking back when I first started computer gambling, I was playing on a 386 dx66 that I bought from Mongomery Wards...",positive
Great CPU but it was running hot for me but still great product..,positive

"Upgraded from a 9900k and had a hotter running PC. Couldn't figure it out at first and find myself checking my AIO, reapplying thermal paste, checking settings, etc. After research I was able to discover that giving it a slight undervolt help. What end up helping even better and easier was typing down the performance in the Performance Menu. In those options by simply typing down the processor to 99% my time went down to 55 for most of my games from initial running at average 80-85. This tuning comes without noticeable hit on FPS except when playing ""Squad"" (a single core use cpu intensive game).",positive
"The Intel Core i9-11900K Desktop Processor is a powerhouse. With 8 colours and speeds up to 5.3 GHz, it's a beast for any task. Plus, being unlocked, you have the freedom to overclock for even more performance. It's the best CPU my motherboard can handle, and I couldn't be happy with its performance.",positive
No issue with cpu works. time is fine for workload.,positive

"No drama, working fine, but seller anywhere didn't mention this is not a boxed version! Seller provides warranty not intelligence!",positive
Just buy the last gene over the current 12th gene. Its heads better value especially when factoring ram costs and motherboard costs.,positive
I am pleased the processor is great function and has arrived before the date set seriously seller,positive
This i9 was my first i9 series ever used since Extreme processor. Works great and sync well with RTX 3080Ti without bottleneck it.,positive
"All right, there was a subject with customs duty I had to pay customs duties to Mexico, but I contacted the seller and sent him the payment ticket and I refunded the full money, since the articles published already included that tax, but the salesman's attention was very flexible and ready, excellent article at great price recommending it, I am recommending this processor 11900k when it is high performance does not carry fans, so they are investigating well because it is very essential the comfort they are going to bring to their best operation, I already have more than 1 month with him and there are no excellent purchase errors.",positive

"ENG: If you know how to properly overclock it you can run at 5ghz with air colled I got 40 on idle and 49 on heavy loads. Does it be better than 12th gene? For now yes, but why? Only because the 12th does a lot more heat and energy consumption and it's not stable for the moment. FR: Good news you can overclock at 5ghz manually and probably more.At this speed I have 40 degrees in idle and 49 in loads. Do you know better than I9-12900k? Yes because the 12th gene is not yet stable.",positive

"Since installing this pcu I have been sturgling with system stability. Not painted the wrong down yet, so it may be a false cpu. It could be another device causing the issue of “watchdog code errors” Update The problem was my graphics card, for some reason it needed to move to a different slot, the system is now stable. I also configured the cooling fans to provide better air flow. This cpu can run very hot when over clocking, although no over clocking benchmark tests still rates this pcu very high.",negative
Very good,positive
"This was Intel's top line CPU in the 11th generation; it used the LGA-1200 socket which was only minimally different from the LGA-1151 socket (1200 pins vs. 1151 pins). The motherboards for the LGA-1251 pins required only small changes in production spec, and the coolers made for the 1151 chips work perfectly on the LGA-1200. By contrast, the 12th generation, using the LGA-1700 socket, required an extensive redesign of motherboards, and the coolers that got adapted from the LGA 1151/1200 didn't really work properly on the 12th and 13th generation Intel CPUs. This i9-11900K will pull around 170 watts through the socket on the factory and",positive
"On paper, it is a very good CPU that I recommend to anyone. However, while buying at this store, I have only problems since I received it. The packaging was not the blue box you see on the pictures but a cardboard packaging with the mouse, probably supplied by amazone, just the CPU inside, directly in contact with the mouse. No follow-up but shortly after its installation (after the warranty period, like by Hasard), the CPU is now almost useless, since the computer is constantly 100% of its use, or works correctly with pics at 100%. More still, playing with the chips is done by the chipper and the chipper is done by the mouse.",positive

This LGA 1200 cpu is robust and easy to overclock assuming your motherboard support overclocking and your cpu cooler support it. The base 3.5 GHz can easily support overclocking to 5GHz.

"I had an i7 10700 that went cap on me, so I figureed, why not upgrade to the overclockable 11900K, since it was only about 50 bucks more to the fast CPU my mobile can handle. I did install water cooling because it does run hot, but let's just say this. My computer now works at warp 9.975. With the i9 10900k, a Nvidia 3060/12gb, and 128 GB DDR4 at 3200mz, on the most widely score I got a 104% for gambling (UFO ranking). I overclock it a lot and it holds up well, and stay under 50c with the water cooling for me. 11/10, would recommend, promote head of peers.",positive
"Would give 5 starts but it didn't come in the blue box instead of came In a cardboard box with a stock cpu of that would never keep this thing cool for gambling.and original packaging doesn't do as with a cpu fan.Don't even know if it's new or used. so be careful, you need an aio or a really good air cooler. But cpuZ is reading i9-1900k. That's good.",positive
"The description said it would be an i9 11900k and it would be surprising to receive an i9 9900k, before selling they should review the product they put on sale, the only thing that matches is the box and they should improve in the packaging of the products, the processor got out of the protective cover, so as to see in the photos, we lost selling in Amazon stores with this will never buy anything like this again.",positive

"If you see too many of these new i9's and i7's put in b550 boards or anything with an LGA 1200 slots and its a waste! This is the latest of the new guys, if you get this cpu do it right, if you don't want to shoot for using its capabilities then get a 10th gene and save money.",positive
The seller did and amazing job. The item came even more than expected. The bad news is that I installed it in my previous flatless running machine. The reason I was upgraded from my current i910900k is that I wanted to enable the NVME.2 4.0 on my SSD. I already had the drive and a Z590 motherboard so why not? I put the new I9 11900k In and it started and enabled the 4.0 on my NVME. May right!,positive
"The tenth gene i9 is better than this one, but I got it because my mobo needed it for the m.2 slot to work. That being said, we're talking about small performance differences in top of the line components, so it's not a big deal. With this thing being $650 without a sale I would never buy it because I can get an i7 from the same gene or it will be just as good. I will say that the photo is defective, it doesn't come into the package on the photo with the cool blue plastic box. It will come as a cardboard box like any other CPU. Everywhere it's still a great CPU and is a great upgrade from my previous i5 8600k, but not the absolute payment $600.",positive
"The 11th gene flagship i9 was a major step backwards in specs. CPUs with 8 colours and 16 threads have recently been reserved for i7 SKUs. Intel last-minute scaled this CPU back because of conflicts with the old 14nm process. At launch, this CPU was a terrible value. As of now, if you shop around you can find this CPU bound with a Z590 motherboard at a very fair price. I got into mine for under $410.00 with an ITX motherboard. This inevitably changes the 11900K to be an excellent value. It works extremely well but remember that 12th and 13th enter Intel i7/i9 will blow this out of the water.",positive
"CPU is great. Not a bad deal if you are building a budget oriented high end PC. Performance is similar to the 10900k but has the PCie gene 4 support which is the only justification for this CPU existence. This with a new z590 and depending if you already have DDR4 ram, this is 1/3 the cost of a new 12th existence. I will admit I am very disappointed in the box. The nice fantasy one pictured is not the one sent. Instead you will receive your processor in a small cardboard box with Intel branding. It should be clear that the box in the picture will not be arriving in the description or by updating the images.",positive
"Products operate as expected, but they sailed this really cheap. It was first shipped up, and stayed in a picked up status for 2 days. Then a day or so later, delivered to usps. Set in Des Moines IA for 4 days. Then it stuck to me after predicted time. Don't ship this way. It's the worst way to ship. So you sailed it in a Thin bubble wrap bag. Should have been in a box. Its a fragile chip, but thanks to you for a good working product with no issues of yet.",positive
"As other states it is not in the box being shown, so the advertised product is not what you get. Although the good thing is the box does mean square to how it runs. Just grabbed this to upgrade my system from a 10th gene i9 to this, only difference really is fast pcie slots on my board (this would depend on your board) and open up an additional nvme drive.",positive
"I Purchased this CPU during one of Amazon's inflexible and short-lived major price reductions. I paid $301.99 for the CPU at the time when it was selling for $389.99. I wanted PCIe 4.0 and Thunderbolt 4.0 and I was considered a 5900X but I found the AMD X570 motherboard feature sets to be disappearing even at the high end. Anyway, I usually buy Intel processors even though I've occasionally bought AMD in the past. I have a very good Cooler Master Liquid ML360 CPU Liquid Cooler which keeps the temperatures reasonably cool. I also bought an ASUS Z590 MAXIMUS XIII HERO motherboard,",positive
"Having eight colors and hyperreading makes for a very powerful processor. This is a very good ""overkill"" processor; that is to say, if you get this you'll outspace software for several years. It also has onboard graphics, so if you're buying this for rendering and just light computing, you'll be okay and won't have to buy a discreet graphics card like a GeForce. That said, this thing can sometimes get warm under heavy use, so a cooler is recommended. I use a liquid cooler, but if you're not using it for heavy gambling, you can get away with just a fan.",positive
Have been using this CPU for a year works great. See some reviews about the box issue but I received mine in the official Intel box.,positive

So far I'm really like this cpu. I Purchased it on prime day for $300 which is not all bad compared to what it used to be and how expenses the 12 gene cpus are. Compared it with the z590 ass strict E that I got for $200 on prime days. It's working out pretty well. So throw in the 3600 cl16 frame with it as this frame apparently runs well with it. Overall I'm pretty happy with this purchase,positive
installed the i9 11900k in the ASUS Prime Z590-P WiFi6 with Team group DDR4 3200 CL14 and ASUS RTX 2070 has this computer running less than a whisper of sound I mean even when the PC disasters up to 5.3GHz then you hear still a whisper from all fans you really need to pay attention to the PC to even notice any sound at all.,positive

"Plain and simple. Get an AIO cooler. I ran the i9-9,00KS at 5.1 Ghz on Noctu U12A (at 66C full load, 38C idle) and it did a great job but I had to keep the case through open. The heat generated (80C) was too much for the front case fans (3 - 120mm) to move at 1800 rpms with the case through closed. The i9-9,00KS is outstanding. I'm getting 130 FPS on average with my EVGA 1080 Ti and it rips through any video games I have. I enabled the XMP profile on my memory to get 3200 MHz. The price point is crazy.

Overclocked on all colours to 5.2 without any problem. So - the KS can run all 8 colours at that 5.2 at the same time - the K variant steps down the speed on all the colors after 1 so the guy saying he has overclocked his K version to 5 on all colours doesn't even understand his own chip.,positive

With a good floating case and a good cooler this CPU runs cool. I use a Noctu NH-U12A chromax.black along with 7 Phantek T-30's and it idles under 30C. Excellent CPU for the money.,positive
I just upgraded from a 10600kf to this 11600kf and the difference is substantial 10-20% difference across the board. everything loading fast and running smoother. PCI 4.0 is a hit with my Western digital SN850 I go from cold boat to desktop in seconds Pros Intel stability no usb issues as with AMD full support dr3200 unlocked CPU no integrated graphics is a plus in my book I get lower time and higher boost clocks because I am not powering integrated graphics that I will never use,positive
"The performance is superft between the two, and this would make a fine chip for any new game you have today. Please note that the F variant does not have a GPU yet for you. This is only 6 times as much as the 11th generation from my living room.",positive
"The processor comes in good condition, the only thing to take care of the box is because the processor's card gets a little maltreated but it's because it's a thin card. Recommendations: Remember that this KF model can be overclocked and requires an external video card to work differently from others (K and without letters) and that's why it's cheaper, but if you've already planned to have a card because it's better, then it's perfectly synchronized with my 3060, and I hope that the card you buy is LGA 1200.",positive

Good quality and this is my dream processor now I am using on last 5 years no any issue yes value for money beginr friendlyly for gambling purpose,positive
A terrific processor works really well... timing fast Earlier i was using a i3 2nd generation...it took around 4 hours to install a Figirl repack version of AC ODYSSEY..now it is 1 hour... Mind blowing.... Search a great CPU.... better part is not having a dedicated gpu... Cost... And more performance is there...... less heat is delivered... What a jump from 8th gene. Now... why 3 star markets sell the same for 11200/-only... 9% increase... I always think that online markets have less price...but now onwards i will make sure of them...,positive
"I decided to write the review as many questions received for the Desktop components Purchased from Amazon in May 2019... As the former MB and GPU (Had i5 1st gene processor and compatible MB then) got damaged because of lightning, I decided to go for a decent latest configuration which is as follows and after 6 months of use the performance is worthy... 1) Intel Corporation Core i5 9400F 9th Generation Desktop Up to 4.1 GHz Graphics 65W (Directe Graphic for Display) 2) Gigabyte DDR4 SATA 6Gb/s USB 3.1 Micro ATX Motorboard 3DZ-Semerged ascord 2D4",positive
"If you have a GPU anyway, then this present great value for the price. Benchmarks are 5-10% better than Ryzen 3400G which is at the same price range. Ryzen 3600, on the other hand, plays 10-12% better than this GPU while costing 50% more. I didn't quite see the value there. Keep in mind that this won't work without dedicated graphics card. If you don't have a GPU or if you are planning to get one after a while, go to Ryzen 3400G. Out of the box, it has pretty good enough on board graphics. Even if you can buy 3600. The other thing to note is the GPU while spending 50% more than 50%.",positive
"6 colours/6thread with 4 Ghz, Best Gaming Processor under ►15000 If your PC usage is going to be Gaming for majority, then go For this Processor.

Best for budget players.",positive
"If you are upgrading your old PC then go for it. It is the best processor for budget up to 15,000. Pair it with at least b360 chipset motherboard or above. Don't use b310 motherboard. It's better processor than AMD's Processor up to 18000. Make sure to go with Intel 5 9600k. For 1080p gaming pair it with atlas GTX 1660ti and 3000hz ram. 1650 is also reasonable choice at smarter than it's class, it can be more than 5 processors. Powerful and good for beginner playing up to 3000 cars.",positive
The box was open at the time of delivery.so I decided to replace it.

Installed a week ago. However, I could not play or install any games as something is causing games to either crash without an error from Steam or downloaded one getting a RAM error, research in progress.

"I don't think the product description is very clear, but any Intel CPU ending in ""F"" requires a separate graphics card. Without a graphics card, you won't see anything, not even the BIOS or text mode: nothing! Only after I received the CPU did I notice it said ""discrete graphics required"" on the box, but also so I somehow expected to be able to boot into text mode, but now, you won't see anything without a graphics card. TBH, this could have done more clear.",positive
"went from roots 5800x to this and I don't regret it. Especially with the ddr5 ram at higher speeds, computer flies even faster with editing tasks and modes.",positive

I tried my heart out to find a Ryzen that could even get close on the performance per dollar and I can't... So the F (WITHUT ONBOARD GRAPHICS) is a life hack for players, like when do you NOT have a dedicated GPU?! Plus the F silicon has been tried to be more consistent in testing over the plain K!",positive
"Be using this cpu for a year now and it's amazing. For every game I play, some of which are known to be cpu intensive, it has only got up to 30% use. Sure it is not a cheap cpu, but it definitely has the processing power despite being an i5. Even when I have stress tested it to 100% use, it still easily stays cool with a glass v5 cooler. More you can bring people that your cpu has 14 colors and 20 logical processors. great cpu, would recommend it",positive
I will always say intelligence is and always will be king of cpus for home or office use. they have been in the game so long and always have done so well that I always recommended them. Even though their rival does an amazing job as well but you can't beat their independence and versatility in all aspects of PC use. Especially if you catch something like a $12600k for under $200!,positive

Mine on the other hand is on a Vetro 360 aio and is overclockd to 5.6ghz all core stable and can get quit hot. Getting 80-88c at times.

"This i5-kf replaces my 11th gene i7-kf. sure, one reads that and first thought is, he's getting downgrading. Well, hang on, grassshopper!! this pop put the 11th gene I7 to shame even when it was slightly overclocked. Very brave cause it's a slower speed but when it's time to rock & roll, it flies. boot time, and app loading is probably quick. when stress/load tested using the Intel tool, it gets very hot. With this processor, over 89c did not cause stumbling, so much must be with this time when not testing.",positive
"At this price point the i5-13600kf is unmatched. I’ve built digital budget pcs and the numbers I’m getting from this CPU are on par with some of my higher end buildings. The card can run hot, but as long as you have a decent CPU cooler you’ll be gold.",positive
"I can use the 100% power of my rtx4080 without problems, I didn't have problems, blue screens or anything with this processor, 50% use as the maximum in games is what I've seen, for editing I don't see any need to go for anything but, tested with Unreal Engine 5, Blender, Adobe Animate, a bit of IA together with RTX.",neutral
"This cpu is a low priced beast. Stunning performance, I mean cmon such a great value for such a great chip. This cpu has more than enough power for anything. 100/10 would definitely recommend.",positive
I got this to replace a AMD 7600X and IMO this blowes that one out of the water in terms of performance and stability (AMD boards too buggy) And seeing that the new 14th Gen is out the price for the old 13th gene makes this the best deal. don't pay more for the 14600k just to get 2% more speed.

"The 136600k is the way to go if you're still on LGA1700 and are looking for an upgrade. In games, I don't see use pass 30%, and it stays cool while playing at a freezing 62°C. I definitely recommended this cpu if you have an LGA1700 Motherboard.",positive
"For this current generation, the i5 is a great choice for bank for bug. If you compare benchmarks to the i7 and even i9 it really is far behind. With a 4070ti I run my games 2k plus settings and get 80-150fps depending on the game. Highly recommended",positive
CPU has really shown itself to be an amazing upgrade for me and is definitely one thing you can add to any building with a LGA 1700 motherboard. It panches far above its weight for the price and actually brought me back to Intel after years of using AMD products.,positive
I like my PC is to play and work very well,positive
"I bought this processor based on the recommendation that it's the mid/upper-mid range for this generation. I didn't do any in-depth comparisons for cost to speed, etc. As I felt it unnecessary. I'm coming from a 2014 Intel i7, so pretty much everything is going to be an upgrade. Everything is working great. Air-cool AK620, the time under prime95 load can reach 100c, which seems extremely hot, but it looks like that's just the way the cookie corrupts with my setup.",positive
"Good balance of single core and multiple core power. Nice boxes. 6 colors is great for gambling, I wouldn't recommend this unless you also planned on video editing/streaming or some other tasks along with gambling.",positive
This is a great CPU for my RTX 4070 Ti building. Very stable performance and stay cool with peerless air cooler.,positive
"For the moment, after 2 weeks of use, it's a very good cpu, I accompanied it with a rtx 3060 12gb and it works well, no",positive
I got it for 250 in 2023 and it's a great product at that price point. I'm using it with Windows 11 and so far I don't have any problems.,positive

"Don't be followed by that I5 name this thing is crashy fast upgraded from a I7 9700k and HOLY the fps wins were crashed up with my 6600XT MSI X TRIO. This thing is stronger than all of 12th genes included the I9 12900k when pared with a decent kit of DDR5 ram I got 6400hz trident Z5 rgb with it and man has been a joy to play on this, everything so cute, highly recommended this chip out of the 13th gene line if we are strictly gambling like I am. Things got it for only $380 CAD never thought I'd see the day where an i5 has 14cores and 20 threads but guess here",positive

Nabbed money for lock 230 or 250 on sale. Worth every penny.",positive
"This is a great cpu. I bought this one instead of Intel Core i5-13600K (has integrated graphics) because the computer I built has a dedicated graphics card so I decided to save a small and not get integrated graphics. But today there was a problem with my graphics card and now I can use my PC until I replace the graphics card. I recommended spending just $20 more for a cpu with integrated graphics so if the same problem happens to you, you can still use your PC.",positive

Works Great!,positive
"I've been using Intel for all of my personal systems and discreet Ryzen being a compelling competitor, I keep coming back to Intel. This CPU performances great at gambling as well as moderate Blender and primers for workloads.

Temp is fine on an air cooled PC. The game stacked just fine and price wise it was well worth it for the speed of this small bug,positive
"I chose this processor for my gaming built paired with a RTX 3070 tea, and I couldn't be happier. I was able to save a small bit of money by feeding the on board graphics that comes with the non-KF version of this processor so I'm glad this option was available. Highly recommended. Works smoothly for 1440p gaming and streaming. Also works incredibly well with my audio software (Presonus Studio One) and all the plugins that go along with audio production. If you’re buying a new processor, get 13th gene",positive
"Put this in an SFF PC and it's incredible. Even coming from an i7 10700k this was a noted upgrade. I would say for anyone who is not doing hardcore production work on their PC there is no reason to get anything else. Only 2 less P courses than the i7 and absolutely rips in gambling and office tasks. 14 physical courses and 20 threads. This is the best cpu on the market right now for the price, it even beats the 12th gene i7 and i9 in most jobs but costs less than both. This thing is a no brainer and the CPU most regularly should be matching for.",positive
This cpu hasn't caused me the smartest issue yet in the 2 months Ive had it. Best cpu for players right now,positive

Fast shipping and zero issues. This chip exceeded my expectations by quiet a lot. On prime95 with water cooling this thing will stay 4.5ghz on water cooling itself at 100c. On games it never comes close to those times and stays in turbo. Put it on an ass z690-e with a h100i cooler.,positive

"Great cpu, had to fill it in msi motherboard because it was going for a tdp of 200+ watt where it's rated for 180. Now it draws max 120 watts and performances at 100% in benchmarks. Hope that will load me a decade-old.",positive
So coming from a 4790k. Now is the time to upgrade. This thing is blasing fast. To note: many motherboards are not on the right bios for this chip. Make sure you download the updated motherboards bios on a CLEAN drum drive and upgrade it prior to installing cpu.,positive

For those who suspect to mount it for a Gaming computer, you don't think so much about it. Buy this processor and you'll save a card and a mother card a bit better. Be aware that in Gaming's performance the graphics does almost all the work.

"Right now this cpu is $250, and it only has 4 colours. You can look up the latest I5 cpus and they have more colors for the same price. In waiting on a cable, to be able to fit in my GTX 1050 TI, so I have tested gambling yet it seems like a fixed processor still. Its great but I think you should invest into the latest generation cpus to get the most of it.",positive
It's a great i5 processor that is easy on the wall but offers the best bank for the bug in my opinion and is a must if you are using a graphics card in the GTX 1070 and above range.,positive
"==>This is my opinion on the i5-7400 <= ===To start looking for a low-quality processor for gambling, deciding to take an i5 out of the seventh generation I am not up, perfect with the configuration I have! My PC is making turns low and wide minicraft only with an i5-7400, 8G0 RAM DDR4 and a MSI H270 Gaming M3 card without a game map to add. ▪ I strongly recommend its processor.",positive
"Good and fast processor, notice the increase in speed, 4 kernels help to reduce time of process and energy consumption, come with included fan, good purchase ratio price",positive
In all cases it's faster than my age I 5 my computer is already 8 years old. And with the new components this I 5 processor works fast. It's absolutely enough for the Gaming PC.,positive
"Buy this as part of my first PC build. Could not recommend it highly enough. Easy installed it into my Mobo (ASUS Prime B250 Plus), and the fan that came with it had thermal paste pre-applyed (though I bought a difference from to use with the CPU). This is the K version, so you can do much in the way of over-clocking, however I don't intend on doing that was perfect for me.",positive
It happened in time and under good conditions.,positive
"Great processor, excellent performances and finally low temperatures also with the stock dispenser. Already, because with normal use (non-gaming) never exceeds 42° and think that with the age generation I was 45 in idle! In not exceeding 55° obviously depends on game by game. In my case I can only talk about Doom (the latest output) and devil 3. The advice is perfect and, if you buy an i7, unless you really need to use seriously heavy programs, I think it is useless and a lot of money.",positive

"Absolutely nothing bad to say about the i5-12500! It bridges the gap between features and performance of Intel's higher than CPU's, which run hot and are legally expensive, and budget entries that are likely to become out-of-date in just a few years. Very happy with the overall performance of this unit, especially alongside and Nvidia 3080ti GPU for gambling, streaming, encoding, and video editing! Runs cool and fast with good benchmarks. Definitely an ideal choice for a budget-conscious, high-end DDR4 gaming system while waiting for DDR5 to hit better price-to-performance ratios. Highly recommended!",positive

"the Intel i5-11400F CPU is an excellent choice to get high performance at an advantage price. With its eight cores and 12 threads, it offers a significant increase in performance compared to the previous generations. It is efficient from an energy point of view and equipped with an integrated cooling system that keeps temperatures under control even during the most intense activities. The installation is simple and Intel support is of great help. In total, it is an excellent solution for anyone looking for a perfect processor without spending a fortune. It is recommended to collect a new PC and to perform a significant upgrade from a previous CPU. Satisfied!",positive
"Processor for middle-level users, although having a Clock 2.6Ghz base lower than other processors, he from the very good account of daily tasks (not a content creator) used for work but in tests he did not lose any performance, it seems to be a colder processor than my using a third-generation i5 warrior, but the cooling that he used and with a 240mm Water Cooler, was maintained at the 62rd grade 63rd grade with it being very demanding, did not use it with Air Cooler, and in games he is very good since he wants to play Full HD with a Video Placa dedicated with Final F video because this version does not have integrated video.",positive
Good price Performance ratio,positive
"Solid CPU, I am not going to share into the states and numbers but before 12th gene came out, 11400f was the best bang-for-buck from Intel and so far its performance as expected. I use it light video editing and no issues have been observed. My suggestion is if you are building an intermediate PC then this cpu is highly recommended.",positive
"Purchased processor for upgrade to PC with budget content. After several research and against my choice, this processor has fallen on this processor. I must admit that it is a pretty powerful processor for those who do not expect the month. Within the package we also find the smart stock dispenser, but I prefer to take another air dispersion, with this combination the temperatures are always low, even in case of stress. I use this processor to play at Fifa 23 which has since this year the new graphics engine, which is also connected to a new video card.",positive

Just great CPU all around. Nothing much to say. There are better now 12th Gen and so on anyway if you opt for this one even in 2022 or its equivalent i7 you will not make a mistake. Paired with Noctu NH-D15 since I am not a fan of water cooling for the reason of being extremely slow it works great. The temperature rarely goes over 55C under heavy load at least for me which just says that Noctu NH-D15 is part of art. Obviously heavy load is based on user base but I believe NH-D15 would do great job under these circumstances. Anyway back to him CPU amazing bang for your bug!,positive
Super Value,positive
"Used on a HPPC/Games PC it's top. It's free and quiet performance (with an MSI Core Liquid 280R, the Intel ventirad is a turbine on an i3, an i5 or an i7, don't even think about it...)",positive

"Processor with a good performance/price report. On the contrary, 1 star less (but try to remove it 2) for the original fan. The fan and just enough to tie your processor in 2 days: Ill temperature => 48 °C, 45% use => 100 °C!!! And without talking about the resistance he generates. I think that no other fan will do better. It is also a shame. The least I found was the ETS-N31-02 (17€!) which reduced the temperature to: idle => 32 °C and 45% use 55 °C...

"Intel 11th generation processor, 6 core. The dissipator with which it is sold is quite quiet and does its work. For those who use the PC for work (so no play and no editing h24) there is no need to change the dissipator. With WIN11 and 16Gb Ram it is very fast, zero lateness on all programs with all open applications you want. For those who do not need ""extrame"" the advice, it doesn't make sense to run to useless power. Moreover, it loses only 64W, a good save on current compared to the larger brothers who are over 100W.",positive

Therefore, in calculating the cost, we also need to set a (good) cooling tower.",positive

"I Purchased this as an upgrade from my 1700x from a few years ago, I wanted more performance but did not want to lose the core count I had previously. I'm getting anywhere from 20-30% performance increase in every job including gambling. I see a 4.7ghz boost often on all colours but never seen the advertised 5.1ghz on a single core yet.",positive
"In my opinion the 10700k CPU is a great high end CPU from the Intel lineup when bought at the discounted price. They offer decent performance, they are unlocked for overclocking and they still maintain the iGPU for times when you might need it. I have bought many Intel CPUs in my time and I really like it's value for money factor. It's not really worth going for the 11th Gen at the moment while there are not much performance difference between them. If you want to wait a bit longer, then wait until 12th gene gets released and compare price/performance again. If you need a CPU right now, get it from AMAZON at the right price and you'll be lucky.",positive

"I know, Ryzens are capper, and you perform the Intel chips in everything... except clocks. As a gamer, I want the highest single core possible, 16 threads instead of 32? Whatever, I don't need that much for my use, lol. I don't upgrade often, and now I was still running my trust 4790k, which still has its own well, but now the 1080th isn't right by my CPU any more, and it's true enough I should get up 9th?",positive
"I have once again chosen an Intel processor: it offers performance similar to a 3800XT. Considering the completion of the production process, it is quite easy to keep under control even from a thermal point of view. The cost remains undoubtedly high for an 8 core but the total number of cycle instruction with a frequency of 5.1 Ghz is almost parallel, and since monolithity guarantees the absence of expected latencies or memory errors caused by the same. Finally a valid upgrade from the first generation of Skylake.",positive
All right.,positive
"This processor is my opinion of the best core of the series i7 The heating is just depending on the performance it can become very high up to 80 degrees, so I would recommend a well cooled system e.g. water cooling Other than said very good quality bin Highhouse satisfied price it agrees with the high price",positive
Fast delivery and great satisfaction,positive
"New processor, for a new machine followed by the old break. Very fast and automatic overlocking top.",positive
"I got this i7 because a) it was in stock b) I had the budget for it c) I trusted Intel more than AMD Ryzen even though AMD Ryzen is considered now as the best hardware (judging by per-core performance). I have always thought Intel's drivers are better, I also have heard recent reports that Ryzen CPU use can randomly go up by 20% with just the epic games store run. I can imagine this will be fixed as it sounds like some dodge code than the hardware itself. On every game I have played, I don't think the CPU use has gone over 40%. So this CPU will definitely last a LONG time before I upgrade. The 11th generation CPUs will be able to produce up to 20% of the epic store.",positive

"I've got my 10700K for a month. I paid it with a brand new Assus Maximus XII Extreme and kept my 2080 ROG. If you're planning on overclocking, I'll just say, pick this up and you won't regret it. If you're not speed-chasing, it's worth the extra money going to the 10900K. If you're overclocking, I personally believe the money-performance ratio is the 10700K on top. But, speed-chasing would pick up the 10900K. As expected, time is a little hotlocking. I spent up to 5.1Hz and left voltage on adaptives.",positive
"If after a few years, I'd also get up and it was surprising that this CPU was relatively cheap for nearly 300€. I have directly added and I'm excited about performance and performance. I'd buy it again at any time. Clear shopping recommendation.",positive
"AMD chips are impossible to buy at sensitive prices. This is last year's Intel i7, the price is OK (silicon prices are very high at the moment) and this is a very capable chip for gambling.",positive
Upgrade of my configuration to new socket and power I bought this K version for just the power delivery very fast. It arrived after 3 days,positive
"I cleaned this processor directly from Amazon on 27th for $387. I've been using it for 144p 144hz gambling and this processor barely blinks and eyes. It has handled anything I can throw at it with complete ease, I'm still to see it get close to it anywhere near full load. I paid it with a night sky cooler and it keeps the chip very cool. My intention in getting this chip is to ""future test"" my chip as much as possible. I got from a 2500K chip, so I want to last, I really regret not having got the 2600K (8 logic colours) at the time that would have last me more than the 2500K, and I've kept it pretty much longer than the 2500K.",positive
It's very good processor and very quit. run so gently.,positive

"When a good idea is gone, with many processors now using stock overclocks, you can benefit a lot by choosing a better CPU cooler. I actually thought it was midway since the Thermaltake Silence 12 is rated for 150w. I thought I could go with a 30 cooler since I am planning on overclocking. That cooler could not even keep up with CPU settings. In Benchmarks the 80-Celse up to 90.",positive
Exactly WhatI paid for,positive
It feels pretty nice to double my core and triad counts with this CPU from the 6700k. I currently have mine overclock at a push-pull radar system and I'm maxing in the 70s as far as temperature goes.,positive
seller is trash as he will message you back when you want to send it back,neutral
It's rock solid profile on the RAM and a small cache overclock. This thing absolutely crosses my previous I7-7000k CPU and I noticed a big difference in FPS in quite a few games.,negative
"Got the CPU on primary day for sale. I didn't actually need the K variant because I don't plan on overclocking but it was actually hungry than the F variant during the sale. So far it's been working wonderfully, with no issues and I saved $127. Big upgrade from an i5-4570. For gambling processes this chip is probably a little overkill but it was so get I couldn't pass it up. However since I had to change the mother board and all it's components for it, which all were not on sale, I still up spending $670 for this chip. Debate if it was really about it but I'm happy with the performance.",positive
"Zero issues installing and running it on a Gigabyte Vision G motherboard. Using a relatively cheap Enermax 120mm Liquid Cooler, and not overclocked, the CPU idles around 30 deg C, and under full load, I have still to have it go over 55. Using a mid totect case with lots of airflow too.",positive
"I like the delivery being really fast. I measured up on the payment info and wasn't able to get it the same day like promised but Amazon got it to me next morning instead. So, that was nice and I appreciated the fact that they got it to me as fast even though they probably could have just said, ""No, you didn't pay anyway, so not the same day shipping."" So, that was nice.",positive
"I know this chip is on its way out, but if you're looking at this and the price is right, it's a good CPU. With a Be Quit! cooler my time is good even under constant load. One thing Intel does that Puts AMD to Shame is the integrated graphics. Especially right now when there are no graphics cards, this will get you a working desktop. I intend to upgrade to a Ryzen 5800X from my Ryzen 3600 this year, but my GTX 1070Ti did and I was left with a broken desktop. I opted to get this so I could not play and the Intel graphics makes the perfect fallback.",positive
only thing is the seller doesn't say it's a used product. when I received the product the box was old looking with wear.,positive
I have been a computer Enthusiast for a while. I have had several different platforms including both AMD and INTEL. I graduated from a 7700k. The 7700k's 4 colours and 8 threads started to show its age with the latest push for higher core accounts. I discussed getting an AMD 3300x. The appal of 10 colours and 20 threads was great and but at the sacrifice of core watches. I am a little heart and I cleaned the 10700k.,positive
"I bought this along with the MSI Z490 Unify as an upgrade from my Ryzen 7 3700X. This thing is an absolute monster that runs any game I throw at it at 144fps if my gpu can keep up. It's crazy. People told me I wouldn't see many winning from Ryzen but in some of my favorite games I was getting 60%+ higher frames. Games perform amazingly well and I notice my loading screens all seem more than 20% faster than my old chip as well. Everything is just bigger and faster, there's less waiting time, and I didn't have any bios issues or anything at all.",positive
would've been better value when I bought them if Intel didn't cut support for quicksync,positive
"Installation went smooth using this 10700k in a rig with a 2060 super and it is cruising fps numbers. I always play fast paced shooters and want as many frames as possible and this thing does not disappear. Come from a rose 3770x. Value and CSGO frames are very high, and I never get any slow down or mouse input it feels great! So a lot of people said this new Intel ran very hot and I don't even hit over 65c at full load having it overclocked to 5.2ghz. Now i do have one of the best AIR coolers out there even if you have a cooler that is not looking at safe and normal time even when overclocked to 5.2 gz.",positive
"I love this processor, awarded itss a lot of upgrade about what I had previously but even with that in mind I still think this is an impressive unit. The base clock of 3.8 is pretty fast already under load with no doubting it would reach and keep 4.6 no problem and with windows performance profiles it achieves 5.0 with ease, and that's with no overclocking.",positive
"I just got into PC building, there are so many chips on the market after 100's of hours watching everyone's favorite youtubers I learned one thing... A lot of chips fit the specs for what you need lol.",positive

I bought this to upgrade my gambling PC and without even running a gambling app I can already tell the speed is much better than my i7-6700k. Things that would require 50% of my processor use take less than 10% on my cpu load. Only big down side is you have to get a new motherboard for this type of socket LGA1200 or something and it requires more power from your supply so make sure you have the equipment necessary before building.,positive
"The i7-10700k is a fantastic CPU for the money. I upgraded from an i5-4690 (locked, non-K) and can immediately tell a difference in a lot of games I play. My GPU (EVGA RTX 2060) is not bottlenecked by the CPU anymore. Don't believe all the things you read about Intel 10thgen chips running hot either. I have this installed in an ITX case with a night air cooler and idle time are between 28-31C. Load time don't go over 60C. It also reaches 5.1GHZ out of the box, no overclock required.",positive
"Got this cpu as an upgrade from an i7700 during 2021, it has been a huge upgrade for gambling. I have never overclocked it and has been used in a deep cool rgb cooler, the only downside for my unit is that it has reached high but still normal temperature (82 degrees Celsius)",positive
