,"Only thing bad is camera quality. Worst image processing device. Speed is good. Charging is ok.. heats up normally. Not more or less . Backup is ok but not best.
50MP cam for a large file jpeg with 8k resolution size, but the pixel quality sucks.
ONLY BUY IF YOU DONT USE CAMERA MUCH OR DONT BOTHER ABOUT CLEAR RICH IMAGES SHOT FROM THIS PHONE",Colour: Jade BlackSize: 6GB RAM + 128GB StorageVerified Purchase,Darshan P,Reviewed in India on 14 May 2024,True,[]

,"Redmi 12 5G (6GB/128GB)

Overview: Having used a Samsung Galaxy J7 Pro for five years, I recently switched to the Redmi 12 5G (6GB/128GB). Despite its promising specifications, the overall experience has been disappointing, lacking the reliability and features I previously enjoyed.

Call Quality and Features: The call experience with the Redmi 12 5G is plagued by frequent drops and network issues. The absence of a visible number typing area on the keypad and malfunctioning call recording further hinder usability. Additionally, mistouches during calls and the lack of a Bluetooth icon exacerbate usability issues. Furthermore, accidental calls to random contacts due to mistouches during calls add to the frustration.

Messaging: Despite granting all permissions, saved contacts' names do not display, making it challenging to navigate messages. The inability to differentiate messages from unknown sources exacerbates the issue, as spam messages appear with misleading identities.

User Interface (UI): The default UI is cumbersome, lacking essential customization options like horizontal menu pages. Third-party launchers like Nova Launcher are necessary for improved functionality, but gesture support is limited to the native HyperOS. UI lag and unresponsive notifications further mar the experience.

Gallery and File Management: The gallery's organization is subpar, especially when distinguishing between internal storage and SD card content. Similarly, the file manager lacks basic search functionality, forcing users to manually scroll through directories.

Camera and Speaker Quality: The camera performance falls below expectations for the price segment, producing subpar images. Additionally, the speaker exhibits erratic volume fluctuations, impacting audio quality during media playback.

Handling and Display: The device's larger-than-expected size makes single-handed use difficult, leading to wrist discomfort. Outdoor visibility is poor due to inadequate brightness levels, resulting in reflective screen surfaces.

Battery and Charging: While charging speed is acceptable, the battery life necessitates multiple charges for a single day of normal use, diminishing user convenience.

Second Space Feature: The Second Space feature fails to match the functionality of Samsung's Knox, lacking essential capabilities such as seamless data transfer between spaces and restricted clipboard access.

Comparison and Concerns: Comparing similar models like the Poco M6 Pro reveals discrepancies in pricing and specifications, indicating potential deception in the market. Such practices undermine consumer trust and warrant caution when considering Xiaomi devices.

Conclusion: In conclusion, the Redmi 12 5G (6GB/128GB) fails to deliver on basic functionality and user experience, making it an unsatisfactory investment. Prospective buyers are advised to explore alternative options to avoid the frustration and inconvenience associated with this device.",Colour: Jade BlackSize: 6GB RAM + 128GB StorageVerified Purchase,Placeholder,Reviewed in India on 12 May 2024,True,[]

,"The Redmi 5G phone is pretty good for its price. It's fast and can connect to the internet super quickly with 5G.
