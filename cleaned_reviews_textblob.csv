no doubt 12th gen intel processors are a marvel of computing technology although there is a continuing tug of war between intel and amd in this regard i personally chose intel core i7 12700k with inbuilt uhd graphics for my newly built desktop pc for those who dont want to use a separate and usually exorbitantly priced graphics cards this processor is a very good alternative it can handle most of the processing intensive rendering of blender easily with its unlocked overclocking obviously you have to use the supporting motherboard ie presently available z690 chipset motherboards it can also smoothly handle almost all the tasks of adobe lightroom and photoshop with no hiccups not to mention the support of 4k video with hdr if you are looking for some decent and the latest entertainment in your pc i would suggest this 12th gen i7 to those who want to use their pc for content creation purpose in the best possible way and also at the same time save some money compared to 12th gen i9 which would ideally be the best anyway but costlier too the price is still at a high level hopefully this comes down soon with the launch of intels 13th gen processors,positive
i have paired this processor with asus prime z690a motherboard and 32g 5200mhz ddr5 ram my usage is mostly for adobe suite for 4k video rendering  photoediting without dedicated egpu and ocassonal aaa title gaming like gta5 battlefield cpunketc the processor works like a charm for rendering and games upto 75hz in 1080p ultra setting overall good processor for the price and more review to come in future edits,positive

so being an amd fanboy i was not keen on getting this but the ct cores to threads kinda caught my eye running 12 cores and 20 threads 4 ecores i think i thought well for the price it should be okay i was wrong this cpu is a monster in my eyes running with 32gb of ram ddr4 and matched with the rtx 4070 gpu being cooled by the artic liquid freezer ii there is nothing stopping this from performing to its max i would recommend this piece of kit to anyone starting out or continuing on with building computers for their high end gaming etc i have not once seen this struggle,positive

i upgraded to this cpu after some heavy research asking reddit both intel and amd subreddits weighing in money vs performance gained i have used amd since i was a teen and started building computers the conclusion is this it is an amazing cpu runs faster and cooler than my ryzen 7 1700 the price and performance vs amd also including a board was better than if i had went with a ryzen 7 5800x  some background information i wanted to upgrade after receiving an amazon gift card i have never ordered computer parts from amazon though i upgraded from a ryzen 7 1700 with an asus x370f board i really wanted to upgrade and was sad also that windows 11 did not support my cpu i will give it to microsoft for this as it made a lot of people upgrade their entire computers all for basically the same os as of now with newer looks and not much done under the hood except for 12th gen intel so good news there too sadly my old board still doesnt support the ryzen 7 5000 series and only the 3000 series they are working on a bios apparently for the 5000 series because of people who were in my shoes i first almost ordered the ryzen 7 3800xt for 400 after a couple hours of research asking and thinking about it i cancelled that order thankfully and thought well if i am going to spend this much on upgrading my cpu i might as well go all inspend a little more for something better as this may be my last big upgrade in this regard for awhile i was then going to get the ryzen 7 5800x with an asus board there lied a problem of price i could not find a board and get that cpu still within my budget atleast not a board that wasnt worse than the one i had in ways i mentioned i had posted on the amd subreddit and even they suggested i go intel intel is just killing it as of now hands down although i am sure amd will retaliate i ended up getting the msi z690a ddr4 i wish i had the money for ddr5 ram i would have went with the ddr5 version as it was basically the same price i had a lot of second thoughts on this board though as it just didnt seem premium as the one i had i am going to do a whole review on it after this ill save my pros  cons for there this cpu also autoclocks itself up or down depending on the load saw it clock down to 1ghz although not for long for example if not much processing power is warranted which makes sense and i wish everything did so if idling it will clock down and save powerheatand therefore longevity is increased i absolutely love this cpu coming from amd anyways  if you have a corsair h100i rgb platinum or similar cooler already the included 1200 screws work just fine with the 1700 socket and this cpu even though you are supposed to get the 1700 kitscrews for this cpu which i did but they are taking forever to ship so i googled and someone said using the 1200 screws will work just fine i get better temps than my ryzen 7 1700 i can even overclock even more but have no need and no point  tldr upgraded from ryzen 7 1700 asus rog strix x370f gaming upgraded to i712700k msi z690a ddr4 parts kept 4x8gb 32gb ddr4 cl16 3000mhz ram with xmp docp rtx 2070 the ram works great with this cpu as well although it technically latency wise runs at 2t on intel instead of 1t on amd runs slower than when on amd amds infinity fabric but obviously whatever intel is doing makes up for that and therefore my ram either runs fasterthe same  pros it is an amazing cpu for price vs performance the i512600k is good as well i almost just went with it and you would be fine going with it for gaming as even it still has more cores technically than the ryzen 7 5800x it also beats the 5800x even though this cpu is supposed to be its comparison rival brother this cpu has cool temps on my corsair h100i rgb platinum cooler and the pe core structure are really cool and fun to watch when doing tasksgaming it shipped fast  cons literally none with the cpu itself just with shipping  it shipped really fast was here in 23 days after purchasing on here the biggest complaint i have is amazons shipping so be aware of this i have never ordered computer parts from amazon and have always used newegg they just left the cpu in my mailbox and if it werent for me looking at my cameras and looking out for this part it would have sat in the mailbox all day my mailbox sadly is not very weather proof as well and if it had been raining it wouldnt have been good although it did come in a big box around it the cpu also was jarred loose and flopping around in the box not held into the front window  i hope this review helps people,positive

this is my first intel build coming from past amd builds ryzen fx athlon phenom i am nowhere near a hardware engineer level to distinguish or feel the differences in performances but for the average gamer and turning on this cpu with instructions followed this chip is very well to be worth it and confident to be future proof until at least 2026 i overclocked this via the motherboardbios settings and it stays cool with a 30 fan cooler dont get a super cheap or small cpu cooler otherwise would risk overheating just follow installation instructions carefully the chip is delicate windows experience rating is a 97 so that says it all if you have the extra 5060 go with the i9 i should have done that amd seems to be all the hype but i see why intel wont be going away anytime soon this is a solid chip,positive

at this time in the product life cycle the 12th gen cpu is about half the cost of the 14th gen cpu it is more than fast enough for everything i do my major reason for upgrading was my old motherboard did not have tpm 20 the cpu was easy to install it is running between 3637 degrees celsius though i admit i am not stressing it i am very happy with my purchase,positive

compared to the coffee lake generation i had been willingly stuck on for 4 years this is a massive leap before buying i was a bit skeptical since im not a fan of intels newer way of handling cores but the first thing i tried when i got it was emulating ps3 games and right off the bat i saw compile times cut tenfold and stability at least doubled  the older cpus from the 8th 9th and 10th gen are perfectly usable for most people so if youre on a budget maybe look on the used market for those but if you really need something powerful this is a good option,positive

this item has been with me for a very short time  so i recently decided to upgrade my gaming rig and after extensive research i made the bold choice to order the intel core i712700k gaming desktop processor with integrated graphics and 12 cores let me tell you this processor is the absolute best with its 12 cores it brings a whole new level of performance to my gaming experience whether im playing graphically demanding aaa titles or indulging in intense multitasking this processor effortlessly handles it all and whats even better is that it comes with integrated graphics meaning i didnt have to shell out extra cash for a separate graphics card yet the integrated graphics offer the flexibility of running dual displays smoothly without any hiccups plus with intels reputation for reliable and highquality products i know i can trust the i712700k to last me for years to come  i hope you find this review helpful,positive

the one i bought one year ago had instability didnt know it was the cpu until it really started acting up had to do a lot of tests with different component to finally be able to pinpoint the cpu when i reached out to intel they informed me about a policy about tray processor and boxed processor basically a tray processor is sold in bulk and they dont cover warranty as for boxed processor they are sold by certain compagny and cost usually more fortunatly the one i got was a boxed one but still intel told me i had a tray processor i had to go on their website and enter my product information and send them the proof that their website is saying i have a box processor it was a bit unnerving but at the en they offered me the warranty and im supposed to receive a new one when they finish processing the one i sent them,positive

great cpu for multitasking i dont know too much about cpu but this is great,positive
its pretty good value for money as far as intel cpus are concerned for a 12th gen cpu but if youre looking for the better value get the i513600k which outperforms it at pretty much the same cost while being a 13th gen cpu the only real downside of the 13600k is that it generally requires a 13th gen compatible motherboard otherwise youll need to flash the bios on a 12th gen compatible motherboard to update the motherboard for it to be able to read 13th gen cpu i highly do not recommend doing this ive tried it a few and its such a big hassle many potential issuesthat i recommend first time pc builders or part buyers to just save yourself a headache and buy a 13th gen cpu along with a 13th gen compatible motherboard dont buy 12th gen mobo which obviously doesnt require flashing bios for the 13600k to be usable,positive
so far so good but then thats what i said about the last one ill check back in a year on this and hope it outlasts my prior cpu  as for the last one its intel dropping the ball with their qc it seems had an imc function poorly and finally give up the ghost and refuse to post with more than one memory module installed couldnt run any xmp profiles and swapping the processor solved it not a mobo issue  just watch for funky behavior when you buy this gen and return it if anything seems even remotely off,positive
not much to say about this cpu its intel and these are immortal still have the 3770k i got like 10 years ago and an extreme i got even earlier than that  so the main motive here is to let amazon know that i have received the item but i dont know how to let them know so they can change the package left at mail to already received,negative

the heart of my pc build and wanted to have the k version with the integrated graphics even though i was going to have a gpu anyways its a good backup if the gpu fails  cant do a pro and con here as there is nothing much to report it plays every game without bottlenecking my rtx 3070 and was a breeze to install there is literally one way to install it youd have to intentionally or forcibly install it wrong also it runs surprisingly cool and doesnt act like an easybake oven in my motherboard,positive
this thing is a workhorse ive got mine clocked to 50ghz and it runs like a dream keep in mind this unit will require a water pump air coolers are not enough,neutral
bought this k to have graphics backup the cpu is great the graphics not so much still i do not use the internal graphics as primary graphics for my pc but only for the purpose of having temporary backup when needed so for that purpose it works the cost vs the kf is fairly negligible so for its primary purpose it is a very good cpu,positive
bought this for a new personal pc my last was an i7 4790k build that got totaled out crushed during shipping after building a new one on a z790i platform the performance gain was stunning completely night and day i cannot say enough about this cpu and would totally recommend this product,positive
the i712700k is in the top 5 for gaming cpus right now amd is doing fairly well as of late but intel has a solid performance lead with its single core performance on newer generation chips  if youre on the fence and want a quick top 5 for overall gaming performance it goes as follows 1 i913900k 2 i713700k 3 i912900k 4 i513600k 5 i712700k  this chip is no slouch though it trades blows with the 13600k in some situations if overclocked but overclocking isnt really fair for comparison  in conclusion if youre looking around this price point check both this cpu and the 13600k pick whichever is cheaper higher end 12th gen intel motherboards can be flashed in the bios to take 13th gen cpus too but do your research on those before going that route this one will serve you well ,positive
its been roughly 67 years since i last build my gaming computer upgrading to this has been more than significant as of this writing i hope youve done your research the i712700ks price point and its competition for this price point it may be the top dog  some things to consider before purchasing 1 make sure you are purchasing a lga 1700 motherboard i went with the ddr4 motherboard because ddr5 is still at its infancy the ddr5 ram may not be the best option for your buck right now youll be fine with ddr4 2 this cpu does consume a lot more power compared to its predecessor double check if your psu will be enough there are online resources that will help you calculate your psu its always good to have a little overhead 3 make sure your heatsink has retrofit screws thats compatible with this motherboard you can purchase them separately if you have a heatsink thats very old 2016 its more than likely it may not be compatible  good luck,positive

the cpu is overall great for everything itll give you flaw less performance in mediocre level video editing and hardcore level gaming and streaming if you are looking to buy this just for gaming this is the perfect buy but the only thing disappointing is the stock cooler first of all i would like to request intel to please stop making this clip coolers they are so unreliable and annoying sometimes it fits sometimes it doesnt and also the clips are so fragile that you might break one someday trying to fit it just provide us with a simple screw and bolt cooler with a proper mounting also the performance is not nice many would say stock cooler is more than enough for 12400f but in my case when rendering a video my cpu temps touched 100 degrees so i took out the cooler and reinstalled it to ensure proper installation but still it was going 90 to 95degrees and it was approx the same case while gaming idk maybe my cooler clips are just faulty that the cooler is not able to mount properly and is not doing any cooling so be careful with the stock cooler or i would suggest to buy an after market cpu cooler or aio especially you live somewhere like india where it gets to 40 degrees easily and you dont have an ac in your room aio is the choice,positive

ive owned more expensive cpus  up to amd ryzen 9 and intel 13900k in most cases these were overkill and ran hot with high wattages most of the work i was doing offloaded everything to my gpu so having a beastly cpu was a waste  ive downgraded to this cpu in my main desktop rig its great for productivity software music and design work as well as gaming i have it paired with a rtx 4000 series card and havent noticed a significant drop in frame rates whilst gaming maybe 15 fps in most games i max out the monitors 144hzfps at 1440p  one different thing about this cpu over other intel offerings is that it has 6 performance cores with 12 threads  hyperthreading and no low powered efficiency cores they are only really needed for laptops anyway to save battery power  the cpu is also very efficient and runs quite cool mine is 26c when idle and 2630 light tasks such as browsing the web during gaming  the temps are usually in the mid 50s benchmarking such as cinebench and geekbench etc reaches mid 60s i am using a twofan deepcool as500 plus air cooler with three case 120mm fans  all in all  very happy with purchase and highly recommend ,positive

intro come  giusto che sia anzich comprare portatilini e preassemblati un vero nerd si costruisce il computer da solo e oltre a questo condivide la sua esperienza nellantica arte del pc building anche con amici e parenti mio fratello aveva necessit di utilizzare un computer e immaginando la tristezza di vederlo con un portatile un preassemblato o ancora peggio con un mac ho pensato di costruirgli un computerino su misura e comunque quale modo migliore di convertire qualcuno al pc gaming se non con un computer assemblato con tanto amore fraterno  ho deciso quindi di scegliere questo processore perch trattandosi di una build sostanzialmente da utilizzo scolastico  gaming e con un budget relativamente limitato ok lamore fraterno e tutto ma non esageriamo mi sembrava il miglior compromesso tra prestazioni e qualit alla fine il venditore mi ha spedito il 12400f ma io volevo il 12400 quindi ho fatto il reso e ho comprato il 12500 che comunque  identico a parte la gpu integrata e frequenze un pelino pi alte quindi lo posso recensire lo stesso visto che sostanzialmente sono lo stesso processore  si tratta di un processore da 6 core e 12 thread che non ha i fantomatici ecores delle serie pi costose per sempio il 12600 ha 6pcore come questo pi 4ecore che aiutano nelle operazioni in background specialmente se usate windows 11 a una frequenza di 25 ghz con un boost fino a 44ghz se le temperature il workload e la vostra scheda madre lo permettono un processore di questo tipo eccelle nel gaming ma non fa schifo neanche nelle operazioni pi complicate infatti questo processore si comporta benissimo anche nel video editing con adobe premiere  lho abbinato a una rtx3060 12g della gigabyte e a 32gb di ddr4 a 3200mhz il tutto su una asus b660ma prime  performance e temperature come dicevo prima si tratta di un processore di fascia media particolarmente portato per il gaming ma che gestisce senza intoppi anche le operazioni pi professionali larchitettura di questi processori intel di dodicesima generazione dopo unundicesima generazione abbastanza deludente  eccellente senza dare i numeri con benchmark e altre cose poco comprensibili vi posso dire che nel gaming si comporta allo stesso livello del buon vecchio ryzen 5 5600x senza dubbio il miglior processore di fascia media assieme a questo non credo avrete problemi in gaming o produttivit utilizzando questo processore ammesso che il resto dellhardware sia allaltezza io lo utilizzo con delle banali ddr4 a 3200mhz quindi come performance siamo simili al 5600x che avevo su una mia build dellanno scorso se invece lo abbinate a delle ddr5 un po serie pu sicuramente superarlo anche se di poco in ogni caso nel gaming si comporta benissimo specialmente se abbinato ad una gpu un po seria come la mia rtx3060 non ho notato colli di bottiglia specialmente nel caso di questa build che sar usata con un monitor solo 1080p  per quanto riguarda le temperature si tratta di una cpu abbastanza tranquilla con un tdp di solo 65w al momento non ho un dissipatore perch non mi  arrivato quindi sto usando il dissipatore stock incluso nella confezione mi aspettavo facesse pena invece  decisamente accettabile le temperature non superano i 70c in gaming anche con giochi pesanti mentre invece sfruttandola al massimo con un cinebench non supera gli 80c che  accettabile e ampiamente sotto la soglia di throttling di 100c anche il rumore della ventolina originale  abbastanza contenuto quindi boh magari lo tengo con il dissipatore stock sicuramente comunque il mio case un nzxt con 4 ventole aggiuntive aiuta non poco oltre a questo non mi fidavo del velo di pasta termica preapplicata e ci ho messo la mia fidata gelid gc extreme perch per un processore da 65w con il dissi stock sicuramente  necessaria una pasta termica di livello extreme  versione f o non f tray o box gpu integrata la differenza tra le due versioni sta nella disponibilit della gpu integrata la versione f non la include e generalmente costa un po meno a seconda della differenza di prezzo valutate se prendere una o laltra io non sono un fan delle gpu integrate intel e cerco sempre quando possibile di abbinare una gpu dedicata anche se scarsissima in questo caso ho la rtx3060 che  una buona scheda da gaming quindi perch ho voluto prendere il processore con la gpu integrata perch con certi programmi che supportano la tecnologia intel quicksync la gpu integrata non sta l a dormire ma viene utilizzata attivamente per lencoding video o per altre operazioni come per esempio la timeline in premiere il fratellino utilizza adobe premiere che pu sfruttare questa tecnologia ma anche altri programmi di video editing o streaming la usano come per esempio obs studio che pu sfruttare lencoder video della gpu integrata per strimmare lasciando libera la gpu dedicata per il gioco  in ogni caso la gpu integrata  la solita intel uhd sul 12400  la uhd 730 sul 12500 la 770 non lho testata molto nel gaming ma comunque non aspettatevi chiss cosa la potenza di questa  simile alle entry level dedicate sui portatili di qualche anno fa come la 930m o gi di l quindi va bene per giochi leggeri in ogni caso non ha problemi di sorta quando si tratta di visualizzare video o immagini 3d non particolarmente complesse regge senza problemi i video in 4k su youtube o giochini retro ed emulatori vari  per quanto riguarda altre nomenclature criptiche a volte vediamo tray o box la differenza tra le due  la presenza del dissipatore nella versione box come dicevo sopra il dissipatore  scarso ma per una cpu come questa  sufficiente se invece il dissi non vi serve prendete la versione tray  prendo il 12400 12500 o 12600 secondo me tra questi tre il migliore  il 12400 e vi spiego anche il perch il 12400 e il 12500 sono fratelli mentre il 12600  a tutti gli effetti il modello superiore partiamo dal 12500 questo processore ha la stessa base del 12400 ma con frequenze di base e di boost poco pi alte oltre che una gpu integrata leggermente pi potente ovvero la intel uhd 770 contro la 730 del 12400 le frequenze pi alte in buona sostanza si traducono in un miglioramento statico in media del 5 di pi o di meno a seconda del workload ma praticamente mai sopra il 10 la gpu integrata  di poco pi potente ma si tratta sempre di unintegrata scarsissima poco adatta per il gaming a prescindere se la differenza di prezzo fosse di una decina di euro ci potrebbe anche stare ma onestamente non mi viene in mente nessuna ragione per la quale il 12500 merita di esistere a quasi 100 in pi evitatelo io lho comprato solo perch mi serviva di fretta e il venditore ha sbagliato a inviarmi il 12400f anzich il 12400 altrimenti non lavrei mai comprato  il 12600 invece  su un altro campo da gioco ed  a tutti gli effetti il modello superiore come dicevo allinizio oltre ai 6 pcore il 12600 ha 4 ecore oltre che frequenze pi alte e la versione k se volete overcloccare per il prezzo di quasi 150 sopra al 12400 potrebbe anche starci se rientra nel vostro budget e fate multitasking intenso o molte operazioni di rendering nel gaming sono praticamente uguali la differenza tra i due si percepisce a framerate elevati e risoluzioni basse in giochi aaa magari in 4k sarete limitati dalla gpu nella maggior parte dei casi in ogni caso se si vuole assemblare un pc con un budget pi alto del mio e magari abbinato ad una gpu pi potente della mia 3060 potrebbe valerne la pena anche solo per la presenza degli ecores  comunque ritengo che il 12400 sia lo sweet spot da considerare per qualunque pc di fascia media valutando eventualmente un upgrade tra qualche anno alla generazione 13xxx quando caleranno i prezzi  conclusione che dire il 12400  una cpu di tutto rispetto ad un prezzo molto conveniente tra laltro  eccellente in una build da gaming di fascia media abbinato ad una gpu un po seria e non fatica nemmeno nei programmi di grafica professionali utilizzati a livello amatoriale o scolastico  sicuramente non vi sto dicendo niente di nuovo ma lo consiglio appieno per build di fascia media e budget contenuto,negative

provato un paio di settimane accoppiato con una rtx 3070 su alcuni giochi online credo sia un processore davvero ottimo sta scendendo di prezzo o con varie offerte si trova tra 120 e 130 euro e a questo prezzo non credo si possa chiedere di meglio  unico neo sar la nuova architettura sar il bios delle schede madri ma il turbo core non va a 44ghz su tutti i core contemporaneamente come era sulle serie precedenti 6xxx 7xxx o su piattaforme x99 o x299 la famosa opzione enhanced turbo boost qui non  implementata ma si ferma a 4 gigahertz  non credo comunque che possa cambiare pi di tanto in gaming visti parecchi video comparativi anche con i7 ed i9 della stessa serie e gli fps sono praticamente gli stessi il che lascia parecchi quesiti sul senso o meno di spendere 3 volte tanto per ottenere poco o niente in pi sempre restando in ambito gaming nella produttivit sicuramente processori con pi threads faranno la differenza,neutral

this processor performs well and is a solid performance upgrade from my old i76700k according to hwmonitor the cpu package hovers around 15w power consumption doing desktop tasks web browsing  email  office  compared to my i76700k video card and psu unchanged new motherboard ram and heatsinkfan  system power consumption at idle and doing desktop tasks is about 5w higher than my 6700k in normal mode or about 15w lower in eco mode in my motherboards settings  synthetic benchmarks 3dmark cpu profile indicate 2x performance for singlecore processing and 4x performance for maximum threads  reallife video encoding is roughly 3x faster using powerdirector  note that this lga1700 socket is known to allow some bending this causes poorer contact with heatsink which may cause throttling this can be remedied by installing a pressure plate i bought a thermalright lga1700bcf for around 12  if you dont need a builtin gpu consider the i713700kf the builtin gpu is nice to have but not always worth the premium if you also dont plan to overclock consider the i713700f,positive
might be overkill for most builds since i5 13600k is a very good choice as well,positive

this is my first upgrade since the i74790k this processor is a beast eats away at any task i throw at it without a sweat i was a little hesitant with the new cpu designs with the performance and efficiency cores but man the efficiency cores alone kill my 4790k  great cpu just make sure you know these shoot to the sky heat wise when you punch heavy workloads and you will need cooling to match depending of how long and how much you will need to pull away from it ,positive
purchased on sale for 334 the 13700k is the best value cpu if you require enough speed for highend gaming  productivity eg video editingrendering streaming multitasking etc this thing is fast i was able to undervolt it and overlock it to 55 ghz all pcore and 44 ghz all ecores i could go higher if i wanted to spend more time on it but this was a quick overclock perfectly stable and runs relativelycool with the undervolt intel is still my preference for cpus and i dont foresee that changing especially with all of the issues ive read regarding amd chips boot up issues crashes poor multicore performance,positive

the highest package temps my cpu gets while running multiple applications is 85 degrees celsius and thats only for brief moments average 68  75 degrees while gaming with high graphics games with youtube running in the background maxes at the 253 rated watts for me which really is fine average of about 100 watts and computer overall idles  65 watts which is 25 watts less than my old i7 4th gen no need to undervolt this cpu even though you can youll just be giving yourself future headaches if you do during the cinebench stress test you get temps that max out at 98  100 degrees celsius but remember thats absolute max mode 99 of users will never use this cpu for more than several minutes at if intels extreme tuning utility does not automatically download when installing definitely get it from intels website and learn to use it it is easy to use and you wont regret it i just use it for monitoring performance but you can use it for easy optimize and underovervolt with too but id recommend doing any of that through your motherboard bios if you decide to most new bioss are easier and safer for that kind of stuff anyway do your research on which to use and how long story short if you want max performance to play around with just get a i9 processor thats what those are made for for everyone else theres this one,positive

after too many years of gaming on an old i76700k i finally decided to pull the upgrade trigger this year i purchased the most up to date cpu and other components with the hope this one will last me as long as the last one did overall i think this is a great cpu however it is a bit frustrating when you try to cool these things intel just keeps pushing these cpus harder and harder to try and beat the performance metrics of amd but in the process they are making cpus that are anywhere from near impossible to difficult at best to keep cool after a lot of tweaking in the bios i finally got this one to stay below the 90 degree celsius threshold but that doesnt account for how hot it still makes my room when im gaming the extra heat was kind of nice during the winter months but as summer is approaching im wondering how this is going to pan out anyway the cpu is completely as advertised and worked flawlessly out of the box i didnt run into any errors or issues with this cpu overall i 100 recommend it because intel has never let me down ive been building my own systems for more than 20 years now too so thats a pretty long track record of cpus that just worked and never died because of that i can easily recommend this cpu and i would definitely order it again,positive
i had a ryzen 7 3800xt cpu for a while now so i went for a new upgrade and went for intel for this generation this processor works faster and better compared to what i had previously this cpu is basicaly like an efficient i9 12900k so if your looking for a high end processor just get this 13th gen also at this time the 14th gen i7 just got released but based on the reviews its more like a 13th gen intel ks proccesor that why i never went that route,positive

im sure the chip works beautifully but i had no idea the k series didnt come with a cooler which is very upsetting for the price point i now realize very small at the bottom of description it says no thermal cooling wish it said that in the main details,positive
i wanted speed without breaking the bank and this cpu fits the bill runs a little hot but not too much to handle with an aio water cooler i use a deepcool lt520 pleased with my build,positive
fast cpu did not come with a cpu cooler make sure you get a good cpu cooler if you play games this cpu runs very hot if you max it out recommend water cooler or large air cooled,positive
the i713700k has i712900k performance at an i7 range price range please note i used an older z690 evga classified board i was required to flash because older boards cannot support the new cpu yet i suggest people who used a 12th gen chipset and were looking to upgrade follow their respective motherboards vendor manual the installation was incredibly easy and i booted the bios after the bios update without any problem i had hit 5 ghz on the cpu without overclocking it also supported 6000 mhz ddr5 ram without any issues after enabling xmp the reasonable pricing for z690 or z790 boards makes the i713700k a good combo compared to amds expensive ryzen 7000 cpus and motherboard costs for people who are still on older generations the vast e cores and p cores offered by intels 13th gen make it worth it to accomplish cpuintensive tasks like handbrake or adobe premiere this cpu runs cool with a 360 mm aio and a high airflow case around 3036 c idle temperature for me i also like to note the cpu fits only fits one way and the cpu lever has a bit of tension so dont be afraid when installing your cpu,positive
i got this for a new system build even though a little higher than i like to spend but it has performed great after i noticed a drop in performance and doing research i found out that these run very very hot and the thermal protection had kicked in to throttle the processor down i tried a few air cooled options that did the trick but they were too loud for me so i ended up with a liquid cooled option which is what i would recommend to anyone using this processor currently my idle temps are around 41c and at 100 utilization temps average around 6070 with a quick peak of 95 i dont personally like to overclock for my own reasons but i did do some overclocking on this for testing and everything worked great with what i did 13th gen blows away 12th gen this i7 even bests the i9 12th gen great chip as long as you keep it cool,positive
open boxused good condition item purchased for my wifes latest build wound up having a better memory controller than my old 13900ks  runs reeeeally cool,positive
the i7 runs a bit hotter than the 13th gen i5 but i just couldnt resist spending a bit more for those extra cores as of 2023 its a razorfast cpu for the average buyer  probably too powerful for anyone but powerusers and videoeditors as for gaming itll run many older games at a high fps even without any help from a gpu and it handles modern titles without any problems too  it can run with a lowpower or stockquality cooler for daily tasks but id recommend investing in water cooling if you plan to throw heavyduty loads at it or goodperformance air cooling if youre planning to buy it once and keep running it many years into the future,positive
absolutely great cpu fast efficient and perfect for gaming its the ideal cpu for gamers especially coming from a 9700k i noticed drastic improvements in my gaming and i highly recommend for others great buy,positive
super fast and stable cpu note that it can run hot because of the higher voltage it can use i made sure to get a nice aio for it coupled with an arctic freeze ii 306 it rarely gets above 30c,positive

very impressive cpu almost on par with the i9 just slightly fewer ecores which if your not an editor or creator of some sort you really wont miss them gaming wise this cpu has hit all my benchmarks with a solid score on cinebench time after time runs a little hot while gaming among other things roughly around 65 to 72c at highest times but with the right cooler you will be impressed does not come with stock cooler would recommend,positive
if you are looking to get the best gaming experience with the decent price and not getting poor processing power this is your option you get the flagship power with lower price than competitor  it is usually huge amount of power however in load but for person like me keeping oc most of the time this is where e cores getting into the play  im not intel fan anymore i wanted to get amd but because amd requires ddr5 and much expensive for no payback compared to intel i did choose this and im not regretting it  so tldr if you are short in budget and want something last long for next years get this one fore sure,positive
its insane the speed you get for its price is absolutely great its granted me a 40 fps increase on baldurs gate and has helped me in development and lighting in 3d applications it been stable at 54 ghz and is amazing for games the die is larger than the older cpus due to its newer lga1700 chipset so i recommend getting the thermalright contact frame also have a review for it overall worth it better if you get it on discount,positive

i replaced a 7th generation i7 cpu with this one the difference in performance is dramatic although i the also replaced the mobo which contributed to the improvement i may have bought too much cpu power the asus diagnostics that i run show that the cpu rarely runs at more than 10 of capacity although i also installed a new gpu so most of the graphics processing is offloaded  installation in the asus motherboard was straightforward although the socket size has changed from my previous intel cpu and i had to purchase a new mounting bracket for my cooler which i did not replace,positive

if youre looking at this as a gamingonly processor youll probably get 95 of the gaming performance this offers with the cheaper and cooler i513600k save your money and put it into a better gpu over buying this because that will actually result in more fps where this processor over the 13600k will not  that being said this processor is a monster its a bear to keep cool but it has the performance to back it up most stable and speedy system ive ever owned 13th gen might have come out before ryzen 7000 series but i still think its the winner  eks nucleus 360mm aio did a great job at keeping this cpu under control,positive
this was the first generation 13 processor we used in a build of course the actual build procedure is no different than before so not much can be said for that our test show it is about 9 faster than its samenumbered 12th generation the other thing we did see from our tests is that again 12th vs13th the newer processor appears to run about 23 c lower in temperature under somewhat similar conditions all in all obviously we will be doing our building going forward with 13 series processors we cant see justification for anyone taking their i912900k out and installing i913900k the gains would probably not be really experienced,positive
amazing cpu noticed huge improvements in performance almost everywhere faster load times higher fps in games etc performance was especially noticeable in cpu heavy games such as wow that dont require as much gpu power and are heavily bottlenecked by cpu in cases like those i doubled fps going from 9th gen to 13th gen intel  one thing to note 13th gen intel is hot you may be coming from an older cpu and used to 6070 c temperatures at max then you might think you did something wrong when this one hits the lower 90s a lot thats just how it is if youre worried about longevity set an undervolt offset of about 010 preferably in your motherboards bios settings and the temps will drop by about 10 degree with no loss of stability,positive

great workstation cpu upgraded my aging intel haswell 4770k workstation to these new ecore embedded intel cpus  only negative drawback is that these newer intel cpus run hot and eat quite a bit of wattage  should have picked an i5 instead but wanted to future proof my new workstation until 2030  highly recommend,positive

blazing fast gaming and workflow easy to overclock out performs mid range amd by miles savings of hundreds compared to higher range amd processors needed to compete  motherboard choices are slightly more expensive but if you already spend 300 to 500 on a processor whats another 200 vs 250  benchmarks higher than or equivalent to ryzen 7 and leagues faster than ryzen 5 sweet spot for cpu demanding games but not enough for the overclocking thread ripping queens though,positive

this cpu is fast and runs cool im glad i chose this over the more expensive i9 11th gen i find it barely breaks a sweat when running the latest games and runs mid 40 degrees celsius with the noctua d15 air cooler i did an auto overclock on the asus motherboard and increased its speed by 41 so i know there is plenty of headroom for the future i didnt like the presentation as my box had the original intel label with serial number covered by an amazon label and not being able to see the batch and serial number was annoying i managed to peel it off eventually and read my serial number the seller explained that this was an amazon label but i think amazon should choose a different placement great chip overall,positive

the i7 11700k 11th gen sits in between the well reviewed i5 and the poorly priced i9 11900k i think at this price i got it at prelaunch sale of 399 its a good product its cheaper than the 5800x performs very close to it and is a lot more fun to overclock rocket lake 11th gen supports specific core overclocks to dial in ratios for the two best cores and other less hot cores it also can take a tad bit more voltage than skylake 145v load voltage supposedly safe according to reddit ama although running at slightly lower all core clocks than comet lake with improved ipc this actually seems to run slightly cooler for me but power draw can be pretty nuts on stress tests gaming load is not bad at all i was seeing around 100w on horizon zero dawn unless you want the highest overclocks the i7 can still get you pretty close or above the stock clocks of the i9 with manual tuning without the price premium and similar real world performance coming from the i910900k the gaming fps is pretty similar at uw 1440p but rocket lake seems much more stable with overclocking  as in you get watch dog bsod errors or you dont  not the whea stuff the ram gear stuff is a little overblown the performance penalty of running 12 is not as bad as what you see on ryzen you can run very high speed ram 4800 and looser timings and get a ton of performance from these chips im an enthusiast and ive had ryzen and intel systems and i just enjoy tuning intel cpus glad to be one of the first to review this this came in as same day delivery happy overclocking everyone,positive

before buying i did a lot of research on what would be the best and quietest cpu cooler as it generates almost two the amount of heat i have only been using it for two months but the improvement over a 10th gen i3 is significant it is reliable so far  one star has been marked down because the chip is so overpriced to be fair this is not the fault of amazon as all suppliers seem to be overpricing these days when we are on the 14th gen,positive

some of the draw backs are basically runs very hot even at idle compared to other generations stays at 40 c with 24 c ambient temp but i concede i think i may need to adjust my case fan speeds to get a more aggressively positive pressure airflow in the case however it barely gets much hotter under full load so perhaps i have tuned fairly well  value is just ok it is a bit lower than the 12th gen counterpart and continually getting a bit cheaper all the time but it is still close enough in price that if you can go with a 12th gen intel build i would have just gone that route i was pretty much limited with my choice of mobo so i could only go as high as 11th gen intel and gen3 m2  but it has been amazing so far in terms of performance under load and i see this build carrying me for 45 years i hope,positive
theres no denying this is a strong processor and if you want to buy something from intel then this or the 6 core 11600k are the way to go  but if money is a consideration or your power bill or how much you need to spend on cooling or what amd offers well you can do better the similar amd 8 core is a bit more expensive but has cheaper motherboards and draws far less power which means a smaller power bill a smaller power supply and cheaper cooling solutions  so yes this processor is strong i wanted to go intel and needed a processor right away so thats why i own one but i feel like this is an offering to bridge the gap to the next generation,positive

may 2021 sometime i decided the processor i dont recommend you do that it required a oven and a lot of patience long story short after delidding and applying liquid metal it dropped my temps over 10c i ran it that way for about 6 months before selling it to a friend but he hasnt had any issues yet either april 12 2021for some reason my cpu is now shooting up to 100c the moment i do a stress test within less than 2 seconds causing it to throttle tremendously i have changed nothing i reseated my cooler thinking maybe it had shifted and that still didnt fix it i am going to check through everything today maybe something changed in my bios for some reason if this cant be fixed ill be sending it back or warrantying it  so far so good ive been able to run this at 52ghz on all cores for quite a while gets a little warm but nothing that isnt manageable seems like all the 1 star reviews are just people who like to comment on things they dont own,positive

dont listen to the review on youtube cus this is a legendary cpu before the 11th gen the 10900k was the fastest gaming cpu in the market and for intel to top it is impressive in itself cpu if you pair it with the right motherboard and rams you will then see its full potential i own the 12900k for over 6 months and decided to go back to the 11gen even though alder lake is more powerful since it is very new it has way too many drawback and the high latency of rams is the main reason why i decided to sell it i think raptor lake would be the cpu but as of now the 11 gen with a few tweaks will outperform alder lake,positive

now with the i913900 series coming out this is two steps down from the top of the procesor market it was just published that the new line was tested to 83gh this line becomes the third choice and the i5s the poor cousins this processor still computes fine and can be used if you need to save some money or where speed really is not an issue,positive
great for gaming even tho amd beats it in multi core workloads doesnt mean its not a good processor its a stable reliable processor and best of all its in stock in gaming it trades blows with my ryzen 5800x so for i havent run into any bugs or glitches thats what you get with intel stability if your only gaming id say this isnt the way to go but my wife does do work station application and the extra cores reduce her time id say this is niche processor and very few people would actually benefit from the extra cores if your just gaming go with a 11600k my daughter build is running an overclocked 11600k and it trades blows with this one,positive

my first upgrade since generation 4 i54670k its fantastic i chose an asus z590 prime corsair capallex 110 rm 650w psu a learning curve on overclocking since 2010 i spent equally as much in ram mobo and cooling but worth every cent youll still need graphics if running under geforce 1000 series but my perfermance with a 960gtx is phenomenal its an intel entusiasts dream and i agree ignore the one star reviews i wont make a ryzen comparison other than my title i do believe amd is doing less with more changes but just my opinion are threads cores and nanometers winning i have my doubts nonetheless this is intel back on its game,positive
wonderfully designed cpu for those that want low power consumption and low temps just leave it stock the 36 ghz to 50 boost is designed to make this processor the swiss army knife of cpus overclocks to 51 allcore easily on the z590 motherboards yes it runs warm but you wanted an excuse to buy that 360mm aio two cores can overclock to 52 if desired probably could get all 8 pretty close to that with an open loop system scores 116118 on userbenchmarks i like amd but they just dont overclock as well plus this processor is readily available at retail price some of the hate surrounding this offering is extremely misguided,positive

despite the stigma with the 11th gen cpus the performance of the 11700k is definitely worth going for the only scenario i would say its not recommended is if the 12600k12700k is available for a close price in which case one would have to account for the additional cost with the z690 motherboards as well as ddr5 if thats the choice,positive

so far so good this cpu is a monster and runs very nicely and boosts to max clocks 6ghz on two cores and 57ghz on all cores unlimited tdp settings but thermally limited at 90c with 60mv offset i have noticed that it runs a bit cooler than my previous 13900kf especially when you consider the core to core deltas i use my pc mostly for gaming and encoding so as long as you have a great case with plenty of air flow and a top notch cooler you can easily run it air cooled without issues as it will just throttle itself when it hits whatever thermal maximum you set in the uefi bios  in gaming workloads it never throttles though and stays at 57ghz all core boost the entire time with temps in cpu intensive games anywhere from the upper 50s to mid 60s and upper 40s to mid 50s in non cpu intensive games  update  i have the cpu now at 58ghz with ht disabled and a 75mv offset and its working like a charm and very stable in gaming workloads and encoding it downclocks when it hits 90c for encoding workloads but for gaming it stays at 58ghz which is amazing since its on an air cooled setup though the setup is as optimal as it gets for air cooling as for temps they are a little lower than running it at 57ghz with ht enabled and a 50mv offset if i use a 75mv offset with 58ghz and ht enabled my pc crashes so disabling ht definitely enables the cpu to use less power  if youre predominantly using your machine for gaming then i definitely recommend turning ht off regardless as most games tend to run better with ht disabled but if youre using it for productivity or a blend of both productivity and gaming then definitely turn ht on  the only mildly disappointing thing for me is that the memory controller isnt as good as i thought it would be mine runs 48gb ddr5 7400 cl34 at 135v on the imc but to hit ddr5 7600 cl36 with stability i need to increase the imc voltage to 141v which just isnt worth it if you ask me for such a minor bump in performance my previous 13900kf could do 48gb ddr5 7800 at 136v on the imc  core wise though the cpu is definitely superior to 13th gen,positive

before you purchase this cpu please also purchase alongside of it purchase a 360 aio as well this cpu is in need of it im not trying to say that to scare you but it runs warm in my asus bios i turned on disabledenforce all limits so that the motherboard doesnt try to do on the fly oc to keep temps low and stability up i havent had any crashes or stability issues at all i did a full platform upgrade from the 10900k to this i kept my rtx 3080 and the performance bump was actually fully noticeable id say my average temperature for doing basic computing is around 37c with my lian li galahad ii trinity 360 its a monster of a cpu genuinely and if you are in the market for an upgrade dont hesitate you wont regret it,positive

i have had soooo many stability issues it is unreal i originally purchased the i9 13900k did no overclocking but had soooo much trouble with the system that i stupidly replaced the mainboard and video card i didnt refund as i assumed that i had done the damage literally months of troubleshooting and doubled expenses before i realized that the asus mainboard defaulted to super high wattage and the chip itself began to degrade at an extremely fast rate yet again assuming that i must have done something wrong i ordered this replacement chip to find issues suddenly occuring again this is about when the news dropped on mainboard suppliers and intel passing the buck on an inherently co dependant series of faults that have personally cost thousands upon thousands of dollars  im an it professional have been in the industry for more than 20 years and have never encountered a situation so costly for the end consumer  i really hate to say it i hold stocks in intel ive loved them as a brand and considered them to be a number one choice i can no longer say this  i honestly think there should be a class action lawsuit over this chip and its predecessor  i had to purchase 2 rtx 4090 and 2 asus mainboards before i could even lock down this issue  i hate to say it but if id gone with a competitor i would have saved multiple thousands of dollars,positive

i built 3 systems using 14900 series they all had serious stability problems when in use after researching for weeks and reinstalling os with no better result i finally disabled overclocking ai overclocking which was running as high as 16v i also found a bios setting after running some tools and set it intel fail safe this allowed me to run the avx2 stress test successfully it basically throttles the chip  i cant tell you the frustration this caused figuring this out everything from chrome browsers to adobe cs would crash randomly for no apparent reason every few minutes while all tests showed it was fine i lowered my refresh rate to 60 from 120 killed ai overclocking and set the intel setting and now have a very stable system it outperforms my 5950x when encoding which is impressive it does run hot even with water cooling if i had it to do over again i would avoid 13000 and 14000 chips as there is a oodle issue as well when it comes to gaming with unreal 5 basically an unfixable hardware flaw that affects some chips  heres the thing you will not notice a difference as nothing i use with the exception of handbrake ever comes close to maxing out the chip when in use adobe cs uses my 3080ti and the intel quicksync igpu simultaneously which rarely went above 40 and usually was around 1520 when editing hw encodes for hd were at 350fps software 250 intel 300 so a small advantage in adobe cs is why i went with the 14900k vs kf  system was using ai overclocking pushing it to 62 roughly single core disabled in bios now specs asus z290a wifi ii corsair 96gb ddr5 5600 samsung 990 pro cpu water cooled 3080ti  so the k is basically useless for me at this point and dont see myself doing it manually as its just not worth it to me that said when stable its a very capable chip,positive
im not going to go over the same performance reviews others have done yes its very fast for only 550 its the king of the poor mans build pc my last pc its replacing was a 1000 10980xe and looking at the numbers the 14900k in average is 7077 faster than the 10980xe the only disadvantage between the 2 was the 10980xe had 48 pcie lanes and ran 32c to 56c hot  i cant say the same about the 14900k heat its spreader is almost half of the 10980xe you cant just simply add a stock cooler or a mcwatercooler and expect the problem will solve itself this is the first cpu in my 26 yrs of building pcs you have to plan out your cooler set up  ever since a 2012 water leak from these mcwatercoolers all in one 2 fan radiator kits sold by name brands ive never trusted them cost me 1500 in damages the only water coolers that dont leak for me were the ones i built but water cooling is expensive and you have to inspect them at least every 3 months for debris in the tank or leaks with air i only have to clean the pc 2x a year  yes you can control temps with an air cooler and get the same temps as a 3 fan radiator water cooler ill post the results without adding a watt limit in the mobo post screen  here is the parts i bought to air cool running the new cinabench 2024 for 30 mins i can get max performance on a defualt non oc not hitting above 99c on the p cores  1 noctua nhd15 chromaxblack  dualtower cpu cooler  140mm  black 2 noctua nfa15 hspwm chromaxblackswap this adds a 3rd fan for the air cooler youll need it 3 fdxgyh 4 pcs cpu heatsink fan buckle pc mainboard cpu radiator fan 12cm wire buckle upper hook type fixing clip these buckles are compatible with noctus 140mm fans 4 easycargo 40mm heatsink kit 40mmx40mmx20mm this you place on the flat base of the noctua cooler will help dissipate heat 5 easycargo 100pcs heatsink assortment kit small cooler aluminum heat these you throw on the back of your mobo on and around the mount brackets youll me amazed how adding heat sinks on the back of the mobo will reduce temps 6 thermal grizzly kryonaut this is the best thermal grease cooler by 12c cooler than artic silver mx 6 7 thermalright intel 12th13th generation lga1700 antibending buckle  a must add a little thermal grease on the cpu side flaps this buckle is 100 aluminum will al help dissipate heat  then i went to my mother board software options mobo is an msi meg z790 ace max select cpu cooler tuning select tower air cooling which will limit the wattage draw to under 300w also note if you are not using a water cooling reservoir you should also use this option water cooling a 14900k and oc really does require a reservoir and a 4x 120 fan size radiator if youre simply using a prebuilt 2x fan radiator its not enough to handle the 14900k and the cpu is known for drawing 370w plus  so using air cooled i got a 2371 score with no watt limiter option an temps were 78100c on the p cores and with the 300 watt limit the score was 2328 with temps 7099c never hit 100c case the limiter would kick in note this is from cpu testing that punishes the cpu realistically i dont see this cpu going over 88c even on the most demanding game in 3 years  i personally do not recommend oc this cpu its already been pushed to its limits by intel at best for another 100 watts when all youre getting is 34 more fps and thats not worth it and all these people bragging a 6265ghz oc there just flexing for clout then they take the cpu back to default i already have my p cores spiking to 6002 at 288300 watts and under 99c temps adding 0198mhz will meaning nothing for apps and gaming  personal note the msi meg z790 ace max gaming motherboard is absolutely amazing at squeezing out all the performance of the 14900k worth the 700 price never crashed during testing that 26 power phases is godly compared to my last gen evga x299 dark had 12 phaserip ega ,positive
this is something that a lot of people do not understand about processors if you put too much voltage you are going to damage it i want to delid it but i dont see the need and here is why even if i can get it 20 degrees cooler it will not matter it will still need 35 to 42 volts to stay stable at advertised speeds i am running it  54 ghz all p cores and this thing is unbelievably reliable  and maybe 10 seconds extra to render vs 57 to 60 ghz i get the point that ppl want to have the bragging rights to say that it runs that fast but it will gwt damaged guaranteed 400 watts is a lot for that little unit i think that 54 53 52 is more than enough specially when you have a total of 32 threads and gaming is practically single threaded  and most games are gpu bound i only use it in the gaming department for flight simulator and have not seen it above 68 degrees i had a 4770 k and still running strong at 45 ghz in a very small case intel is a beast and this i 9 is very good  future proof for at least 5 years to come  note i have delided at least 20 cpus and the ones that got damaged were the ones that got a lot of voltage  they are very heat resistant but voltage just kills them  i have been running this cpu 24 7 not an issue not a blue screen just underclock and undervolt and you are good to go this thing is a monster ,positive
so i finally upgraded my home workstation and went to this new i914900k it is incredibly fast i had a davinci resolve video project file that i rendered on my old setup the i76850k and it took just over 22 minutes to complete the render on the new i9 the exact same file was re exported took just over 8 minutes almost a 3x speed increase also when you speed up footage in resolve the old cpu could not play it back smoothly it would jump and chug like crazy the new i9 it plays it back sped up 800 no problems and i can actually see how it looks without having to export the entire video clip to see it playback the retimed footage smoothly applications open u p much faster too but that could be more due to the pcie40 nvme system drive that is much faster than the previous version nvme i had in the old build the one thing i do not like about the new cpu is the number of pci lanes you only get 20 16 are pcie50 and 4 are pcie40 this wont be an issue for most people but my old cpu had 40 lanes allowing me to run 3 gpus at the same time and yes i needed them i use gpu rendering software that can use up to 8 gpus in one system on one license and every additional gpu speeds up your render times a lot when rendering out 3d sims with this new cpu i can only run 2 gpus and they run at 8x cause they share the 16x and that does leave me 4 full pcie40 lanes for the system drive it is not a deal breaker and the increased speed overall is well worth it one thing everybody should be aware of is these new intel chips have p cores and e cores something my old cpu did not have ecores can severely impact certain software performance when i booted up the new machine and tried my ableton daw for the first time i was expecting to be so happy with a performance boost and the software was literally almost unusable the ecores were slowing the software down so bad i could barely change settings in the preferences it was that bad i had to install process lasso  fantastic software that is free if you have never heard of it  and disable the use of ecores for ableton and then it worked very fast and is great,positive

even running at the default 61ghz turbo settings the processor is extremely unstable and causes constant crashing only way to stop it is to go in bios and set the core ratio to 57 max for power cores and 43 for efficency cores drove me nuts trying to figure out the problem for months also buy a hefty duty power supply if youre buying a 40 series rtx graphics card constant crashing of apps and games from lack of power to the graphics card from even a 1000 watt supply,negative

once they came down in price i did get a i914900k as an upgrade from a i913900kf to i914900k  its ok but i cant rave over it it is more of an sideways change rather than an upgrade  the i914900k is fast but not more so that a i913900k for me the cinebench r23 scores are about the same for 13th versus 14th gen though the i914900k appears to run ddr5 more stably and at higher frequencies than the i913900k also the i914900k is enabled for xtu ai enable tuning in xtu but its not that helpful i even wonder if it is worth getting a k at all these cpus are plenty fast for gaming without overclocking  i did not notice a significant improvement in the operating temperatures maybe a slight improvement but i did flush out the cooling system and clean out the water block so i am doubtful that the running temps are better also i suggest that you not let these chips get anywhere near tjmax 100c i had one i913900kf literally fail due to allowing it to get to tjmax frequently when stress testing a second one became slightly flaky  i thought the built in arc display support of the k version might be helpful since i intended to devote the graphics card to the gaming monitor and use the builtin arc on a side display but as it turns out it wasnt worth it for me if you are gaming with this level of processor you really need a comparable graphics card but most of them will drive four displays imo you are better off getting a kf and spending the money so saved on better graphics card  the original asking price was insane i bought it on a whim on a late night on the morning morning after i had buyers remorse tried to cancel but could not so instead i refused the package it took literally 6 months to get a refund that was rather irksome,positive

words truly cannot express how powerful but also how hot this cpu is after upgrading from a ryzen 3700x to this my work speed gaming everything cannot lay a finger on this thing the only times ive seen this truly cap out is during extreme compression decompression and specific rendering situations the only con which isnt truly a con is that this chip can get incredibly hot if youre going to get this i would absolutely suggest a 360 aio cooler or youre going to experience thermal throttling or even thermal shutdowns that was my original issue but quickly upgraded coolers and this thing is a monster,positive

im definitely gonna upgrade later but this is handling itself pretty well with dragon dogma 2 to fortnite and everything inbetween only gripe is that theres no small arrow on the actual cpu to indicate where to place it on motherboard so if you tossed the packaging without looking you might be bit confused with orientation otherwise good,positive
wanted to purchase the unlocked version of the 20 core 14th gen processor and saw that this was a cheaper option at the time all the description says is that discrete graphics is required it would be much more helpful by adding a line that says the f version stands for no integrated graphics card if youre doing any kind of workstation work such as video editing most software will take advantage of the processor having an igpu as well and so im actually losing performance with this model version ill have to return the item to purchase the correct version without an f i would give it a full 5 stars if it had the line explaining the f version,positive

a lot of people are upset with the 14900k because of the minimal performance leap thar came between it and the 13900k i say who cares if you have a 13900k dont upgrade but if you have an older pc or 12th gen this is a worthy upgrade i absolutely love mine its a monster of a cpu  i honestly dont recommend air cooling it it can get pretty hot and there are only a small handful of air coolers that can handle this 14900k without setting power limits which most people dont know how to do let alone even know what that means  if youre not doing a custom water loop to cool your 14900k i recommend you do what ive done to cool mine you dont neeeed to but it helps i have an aio allinone cooler and i setup a pushpull configuration on my radiator that means i have 3 fans on the bottom blowing in through the radiator and 3 more fans blowing up and out of the case both are blowing upward it creates more airflow one side is pushing the air the other side is helping pull that air through then i got a thermalright contact frame any lga 1700 contact frame should work but the thermalright version is cheap it might say 12th13th gen but it will also work on 14th gen so get an aio setup a pushpull fan configuration and get a contact frame its helping my temps significantly i typically stay in the high 50s or low 60s during 4k gaming this cpu draws a ton of power so you might see it bump up to 80 occasionally for a very brief moment maybe 1 second or less,positive

this is the first time ive ever went for it and got an i9 i usually stick to the i7 i am so glad i decided to take the chance because this thing screams to think that i can also squeeze out more by overclocking is just insane every application ive ran is so snappy and responsive being an impatient human this thing makes me happier every time i turn it on power and speed are right where i like it this chip is just so damn sweet,positive

as a gamerdata scientistprogrammertinker i wanted a mainstream cpu built by a well established company with intels i914900k cpu i have a top of the line general purpose chip which provides above average performance in all the computational fields i have an interest in i only gave it a 4star rating because i had hoped that intel would have brought the 15th generation chips out in 2023 q4 as they said rather than just the mobile chips,positive
this is an excellent stable cpu care must be taken to keep it cool it is a hot running cpu to avoid heat throttling at 100deg celsius in heavy duty gaming or testing order a high end liquid cooler for professional work and easy gaming a big block fan cooler will be just fine as it is much more quiet to save a little money if at all the i913900k will work just as well performance wise,positive

even youre getting hotter temps despite having great cooling its normal for this cpu its a beast i recommend using a triplefanradiator aio cooler to keep this bad boy as cool as possible and make sure to blow the hot air out of your pc case,positive
sorta came from a 13900k but i gave that to a relative after their x299i97940x system began to have issues he bought a z790 board and was amazed how far ahead the 13900k is in comparison an overclocked skylakex processor he fixed the issue with the x299 system but he decided to stay with raptor lake all of which is okay by me because that old 13900k had no overclocking headroom and i could only undervolt it by 5mv before it became unstable i was going to buy another 13900k or maybe the ks version but i decided to wait for the 14900k  the 14900k i got on the other hand has some overclocking headroom i already set all pcores to 58ghz while keeping the doublecore turbo boost at 60ghz i also set the cache to 52ghz and its completely stable i was not able to raise the multiplier at all with my 13900k just happy my 14900k isnt a lottery loser  while the clock of both the 13900ks and 14900k are the same the 13900ks has a cherry picked memory controller if youre looking to do a ton of ram overclocking then the 13900ks may be the way to go but thats not to say if youd get a 14900k with a good memory controller both my 13900k and 14900k work with ddr57200 ram with xmp set and no adjustments to the memory controller voltages  if youre buying the 14900k off the getgo and building a new system around it then i recommend pairing it with a motherboard that has the bios flashback feature,positive
not sure what more to say other than its crazy powerful make sure you have a high watt power supply to go with this and all the devices you plan to run with this and really dont go small on the cpu cooler this thing is good at figuring out when to throttle down youll get its best performance with a large aio water cooler if you can build your own water cooling system better  also make sure your mobo manufacturer have all the drivers available to work smoothly with these lines of processors,positive
it arrived in a sealed package but it was stained and with a thumbprint on it looks like it might have had thermal paste removed im not crazy about that because i paid for new but it seems to work fine,positive
i built pc with the new intel i914900k and i must say its a beast of a processor coming from an i78700k the performance boost is nothing short of incredible multitasking gaming and content creation have all seen a significant improvement multithreaded applications and gaming experiences run smoother its a productivity powerhouse the clock speeds are no slouch either making it excellent for singlethreaded tasks and gaming the major downside of this cpu is the heat it generates even with a highend cooling solution it tends to run hot and thats something you must take into consideration when setting up your cooling solution be ready for this cpu to draw a significant amount of power at full load it can put quite a load on your power supply and might necessitate an upgrade if youre not already prepared the intel i914900k is an incredible processor and the upgrade from an i78700k is substantial its exceptional performance in various tasks justifies its price tag if youre willing to address these challenges youll be rewarded with a fantastic computing experience,positive
no issues with this seller or product but for those that are looking for a new pc part the 14900 k is merely a refinement over the 13900k which you may be able to find cheaper,positive

may be a little excessive and unnecessary but glad i got one when i did sometimes these things get hard to acquire especially at a decent price  seems to run a little hotter than my ryzen 9 7950x so i went with dual 420mm if you buy this cpu you should really consider custom loops or large cases with 420mm aio support,negative
the i9 14900k is undoubtedly a very powerful cpu just for gaming i wouldnt recommend for gaming and working yes also think about a good cooling solution custom watercooler cryo andor undervolting depends on mobo a regular 360mm aio has a hard time keeping this cpu cool,positive

this cpu is for work use it is very stable at stock speeds it worked great right out of the box i doubt if i will ever have to think about it again i recommend it for real world use as for gaming i just cant say how it would perform,positive

the i7 14700kf isnt just a cpu its a beast unleashed this 20core powerhouse purrs like a kitten under normal workloads staying surprisingly cool thanks to its 7nm architecture but dont be fooled by its initial demeanor this cpu is a wolf in sheeps clothing ready to tear through any demanding games and content creation tasks with ease i paired with an rx 7900 xtx and forgot about frame rate drops and stuttering,positive
i had a minor hiccup with my new 14900kf but i contacted intel and their customer service was fantastic they sent me a new one and its working great now this thing is like a buzz saw in gaming i have a negative offset on the voltage of 00500v and the hottest ive seen it get was 62c while playing horizon zero dawn maxed at 4k it was getting as high as 190 fps every now and then this cpu is brutal man top flight customer service too,positive
a very powerful processor but if it does not have good cooling its functions will be limited currently it is working wonders together with the other components but if they have a moderate cooling system it is advisable to use the other brand of processors amd that has half the temperatures but with 10 to 20 less performance in some activities and with the defects that come with not have an architecture that selfprotects well or do not update its software often for better handling  finally i recommend the processor only if you have a processor that does not meet current needs my i7 6700k can do it all but for some specific technologies such as ssd gen 4 peripherals with highspeed usb  c and others it couldnt cope,positive
decided to go intel over amd and this cpu will not disappoint you id recommend looking into the ecore and pcore information before you buy havent noticed any issue with it but still a nuisance,neutral
awesome cpu thing can handle anything and everything for at least my needs as a gamer and programmer highly suggest getting a 360 aio or a custom water loop and a cpu bracket if you are getting this cpu it runs very hot getting a cpu bracket cut down my temps about 510 degrees im not sure how good air coolers are for this cpu but ive seen a lot of people not suggest it i use a 360 aio loop and it works great at keeping this thing cool,positive
perfect easier to install than i thought as a first time processor install for me worth while performance increase from my also good 12700 and helped unleash the power of my 4090oc gpu,positive
fast temperatures are good 35 at ideal and around 60 at load those people who are saying its hot actually they dont have this processor not much expensive in other countries its only expensive in india because of 42 tax so if you love intel and want the same performance as core i9 9900k then this is for you because core i9 10900k is out of stock now,positive

had this for about 2 weeks and is brilliant managed to get it up to 55ghz on a asus z490 the only downside to this chip is that its very very hot with a double rad aio at 51ghz i hit 90c max and idle around 35c but upgraded to a full custom loop and now it has all the cooling it needs and it actually out preforms the i9 at 54ghz so keep that in mind for you overclockers all in all brilliant value and performance and the perfect match for my fe 3080 the only problem was delivery it came very dinged up and left in the damp,positive
dont let the 125w tdp fool ya because this chip runs way cooler than previous gens tested temps using occt stress test for about 3 hours alongside my noctua nhd15 cooler the highest ive seen the temp spike up to was 71c note that occt is a heavy synthetic test that pushes the cpu to the limit regular gaming temps will never reach that high ive had the chip for almost two months now and accumulated quite a bit of gaming hours during that time the games i played included a mix of intensive aaa titles like cod warzone and ac odyssey to light esport ones such as rocket league and rainbow six siege highest temps are always in the 50s to mid 60s range that is a huge difference compared to my old i5 6600k that spiked to over 80c at times my brother who bought a 9900k last year was also amazed by how much cooler 10th gen runs and even said that he wished he waited a bit longer before upgrading note that both the 9900k and 6600k have lower tdps than the 10700k yet still run warmer the reason as to why 10th gen runs cooler is because intel made modifications to the ihs of the cpu and upgraded their thermal interface material other then the improvement in the temperature department ive also noticed a big difference in gaming performance despite having a 2080 super my pc used to struggle to reach and stay at a consistent 100fps at 1080p cpu intensive games like ac odyssey often dropped to like 50fps this is a clear indication that there was bottleneck on the cpu side with this new 10700k my pc now has no problems reaching and maintaining that sweet consistent 144 fps on light competitive esport titles and 100fps on demanding cpu intensive aaa titles also note that i am running the cpu at stock settings right out the box and have not messed with overclocking yet nonetheless i am very satisfied with this cpu and i highly recommend it,positive

works great the original one i got from amazon died on me within 2 weeks it was essentially dead on arrival this rarely happens but from time to time this can happen  i contacted intel and asked for a replacement and they agreed as it was under warranty obviously while i had to pay like 10 to ship it to them which i originally thought was sorta cheap since other companies like msi cover the shipping costs i can see why intel doesnt  while i only paid 10 for shipping i assumed it would be ground shipping from canada to the middle of the usa and figured id be without a cpu for up to 2weeks  turns out intel ships via air and my package was on a plane and arrived at the facility within 8 hours and i had a new cpu in my computer within 72 hours  i would highly recommend this product even after my issues because intel was as fast as possible with replacing mine  after using this product for a few months its worked great and performs perfectly and ive had no issues since getting the original replaced,positive
i waited too long to switch back to the fps king this chip is amazing i missed you intel  the pc world is weird always chasing 50 savings too many games have cpu bottlenecks i debated hard between just buying a 3700x to replace my 2700x versus the hard mbcpu upgrade to intel but amd had left me frustrated my 2700x was never maxed out and i couldnt tell what was bottleknecking me the 3700x didnt promise much higher clock speeds so i wasnt sure if an upgrade would help i play rust on 1440p and my gpu and cpu would sit at 60 utilization or less with frames only around 70fps first test with the 10700k stock and im at 135fps max graphic settings my gpu is now pumping out 99 utilization and the game feels amazing  this chip runs cool on stock idk where all the bad thermal predictions came from but it didnt happen havent even ocd it yet and honestly i may not need to until i upgrade off of my 2080super but thats not happening any time soon im hitting 144fps on 1440p max settings now in every fps game and that was the goal  thank you intel you nailed this one the 9th gen had some costheat issues and that made me give amd a try and im glad to be back  for anyone choosing a card the 10700k is the sweet spot for gaming and streaming if you only game i think the 10600k is a cheaper but same performance i dont see any need for the 10900k,positive

this cpu has 38ghz base clock my old cpu had a boost clock of 38ghz and rarely reached it this cpu is perfect havent had any issue yet other than it does run a little hot but i have a huge cpu cooler so its only reaching high 60s on not hugely intensive games,positive
a considering its current price and given that its gaming performance without power limits is overall identical to the 11700k without power limits too and just 34 slower overall than the 5800x i would say this cpu is the best choice for gaming after overclocking it actually beats or matches the 5800x overall even when compared against a pboed 5800x by overall i mean when comparing these cpus in a large range of games 30 games and not just 45 something that some biased reviews do  b productivity is very good too although in heavy multithreaded applications eg tilebased rendering it does lose by 1020 to both the 11700k and the 5800x that said it reduces the deficit to only 315 in an overclocked vs overclocked battle thanks to its higher overclocking potential  c it runs pretty cool  i am using a noctua nhd15 and is also very silent even on stock auto motherboard settings and with power limits removed i dont get temps above 6869c even when running cinebench r23 in a loop and sustaining indefinitely the stock allcore 47ghz temps reduce further when you manually tune the voltage to a lower value a practice known as undervolting or when you apply a better thermal paste or a case with better airflow you can also undervolt and still overclock or overclock more without increasing the voltage above its stock value  d i paired it with a fairly highend asus z490 strixe board instead of a z590 one there is no reason buying a z590 board for 10th gen cpus as for the same price you typically dont get enthusiast features such as postcode third pcie x16 slot pcie bifurcation etc moreover most of the goodies of the z590 boards eg pcie4 additional m2 slot dmi3x8 are only enabled when using an 11th gen cpu so buying a z590 for 10th gen is a bit of a waste  e currently the price of the 11700k z590 is around 200 euros higher than that of the 10700kz490 combo if the difference drops to 6080 euros then i would advise to go for the former instead but as of now the 10700kz490 combo is the wiser choice,positive

in the my opinion the 10700k cpu is a great high end cpu from the intel lineup when bought at the discounted price they offer decent performance they are unlocked for overclocking and they still maintain the igpu for times when you might need it  i have bought many intel cpus in my time and i really like the 10700k due to its value for money factor  its not really worth going for the 11th gen at the moment while there arent much performance difference between them if you want to wait a bit longer then wait until 12th gen gets released and compare pricingperformance again if you need a cpu right now get it from amazon at the right price and youll be sorted,positive

while a good idea anyway with many processors now utilizing stock overclocks you can benefit a performance boost by choosing a better cpu cooler i went the cheap route actually i thought it was middle of the road since the thermaltake contac silent 12 is rated for 150w i thought i could get away with a 30 cooler since i am not planning on overclocking that cooler could not even keep up with stock cpu settings in benchmarks the cpu hit 80celsius in seconds and gradually up to 90 where i had it set to throttle in more practical testing under basic workloads the temps are more reasonable but the contac silent 12 has to ramp up to 100 fan speed frequently to keep that way and it is not quiet at that speed i know somebody is going to say thats because the default settings on the motherboard are overclocking the cpu beyond intels recommended settings well that was one of the first things i checked and thats not the case here despite what somebody on youtube said or didnt say not all motherboards do that it is a great processor and complements my workload nicely no games here the new cooler is a reeven justice 45 right now i has the same size 120mm fan however it has six heat pipes instead of four and the tower is about 50 thicker and fins stacked closer together temps while still pretty hot have come down 810 degrees on cinebench r20 it still gets up to 8082 celsius but instead of hitting 80 right away as it did before it takes until the render is almost complete and seems to level off there i feel better about the temps now that its not riding on the ceiling especially since all core full load is not a typical workload for me the fan is much quieter during typical use i would recommend that cooler for those who are looking for a good compatible cooler,positive

it feels pretty nice to double my core and thread counts with this cpu from the 6700k i currently have mine overclocked at 52ghz with a pushpull radiator liquid aio system and im maxing in the 70s as far as temperature goes definitely adds some fps to call of duty and control i havent tried red dead or gta v yet but since theyre usually so cpu bottlenecked im sure theyll run great with this  my config in case anyone wanted to know cpu 10700k cooler  corsair h105 mb gigabyte aorus z490 graphics rtx 2080 super ram  4 x 4gb ddr4 2 samsung 860s and 1 m2 870 id recommend picking up an m2 if you go with gigabytes now motherboards theyre putting 24 slots on their mbs now so i feel like its just untapped potential if youre not going to be using at least one of those slots power evga 750w 80 gold i think case  i did have everything in an nzxt s340 but i just moved it all into that new corsair mesh case that came out td500 mesh and airflow and aesthetics are superb,positive

paired with a asus rog strix z490e gaming board i was able to easily and quickly achieve a 50ghz all core overclock on air cooling its rock solid stable with xmp profile on the ram and a small cache overclock this thing absolutely crushes my previous i77000k cpu and i noticed a big difference in fps in quite a few games  i think i may have gotten lucky on the silicon with this chip i can hit 51ghz stable but it does start to get a little too hot for my comfort but i actually dont start thermal throttling until i try 52ghz all core again this is just on air using a noctua dhd15 so its possible i could do more with an aio cooler with enough cooling and time spent tweaking this chip may very well hit 52ghz all core and remain stable ill update the review if i ever give that a shot  its expensive of course because its intel but if intel is your jam you cant go wrong here,positive
got the cpu on prime day for sale i didnt actually need the k variant because i dont plan on overclocking but it was actually cheaper than the f variant during the sale so far its been working wonderfully with no issues and i saved 127 big upgrade from an i54570 for gaming purposes this chip is probably a little overkill but it was so cheap i couldnt pass it up however since i had to change the mother board and all its components for it which all werent on sale i still ended up spending 670 for this chip debatable if it was really worth it but im happy with the performance,positive
zero issues installing and running it on a gigabyte vision g motherboard using a relatively cheap enermax 120mm liquid cooler and not overclocked the cpu idles around 30 deg c and under full load i have yet to have it go over 55 using a mid tower antec case with lots of airflow too of course anyone who is buying just a cpu is probably fully aware of what cooling issues they may or may not run into included my info just to help i got mine on sale but even at sale prices intel are never cheap i have never had an issue with any intel cpu i have used and if this cpu holds up like my old i73770k did i wont have to upgrade again for several years happy with the purchase,positive
i like the delivery being truly fast i messed up on the payment info and wasnt able to get it the same day like promised but amazon got it to me the next morning instead so that was nice and i appreciated the fact that they got it to me as fast as possible even though they probably could have just said no you didnt pay properly so no same day shipping so that was nice i will construct my pc once my motherboard comes in in sha allah so we will see if the processor is good,positive
i know this chip is on its way out but if youre looking at this and the price is right its a good cpu with a be quiet cooler my temps are good even under constant load one thing intel does that puts amd to shame is the integrated graphics especially right now when there are no graphics cards this will get you a working desktop i intended to upgrade to a ryzen 5800x from my ryzen 3600 later this year but my gtx 1070ti died and i was left with a broken desktop i opted to get this so i could work even if i couldnt play and the intel graphics makes the perfect fallback heck i could even play factorio and portal on my 3440x1440 monitor,positive

i have been a computer enthusiast for a while now i have owned several different platforms including both amd and intel i upgraded from a i7 7700k the 7700ks 4 cores and 8 threads started to show its age with the recent push for higher core counts i debated getting an amd 3900x the appeal of 10 cores and 20 threads was great and but at the sacrifice of core clocks i am a gamer at heart and do little videophoto editing the decision was made in my mind and i purchased the 10700k out of the box the 10700k boost to 51ghz yes 51ghz insanity while intel is still on a 14 nano meter architecture compared to amds 7 intel has refined the process to undoubtedly still beat amd in gaming i have no complaints about the 10700k it is satisfying to know i wont need to upgrade for years now,positive
i bought this along with the msi z490 unify as an upgrade from my ryzen 7 3700x this thing is an absolute monster that runs any game i throw at it at 144fps if my gpu can keep up its crazy people told me i wouldnt see many gains coming from ryzen but in some of my favorite games i was getting 60 higher framerates games perform amazingly well and i notice my loading screens all seem about 20 faster than my old chip as well everything is just smoother and faster theres less waiting time and i didnt have any bios issues or anything at all installation was easy honestly this is probably overkill unless you have a nice rtx graphics card but its a wonderful cpu the temps arent too crazy with a 280mm aio i think ill be happy with this chip for the next 5 years at least,positive
wouldve been better value when i bought them if intel didnt cut support for quicksync,positive
installation went smooth using this 10700k in a rig with a 2060 super and it is crushing fps numbers i mainly play fast paced shooters and want as many frames as possible and this thing does not disappoint came from a ryzen 3770x valorant and csgo frames are very high and i never get any slow downs or mouse input delay it feels great  also a lot of people said this new intel gen ran very hot and i dont even hit above 65c at full load having it overclocked to 52ghz now i do have one of the best air coolers out there so even if you have a cooler that is not as good you are looking at safe and normal temps even when overclocked to 52 ghz,positive
i love this processor granted its a huge upgrade over what i had previously but even with that in mind i still think this is an impressive unit the base clock of 38 is pretty fast already but under load with no tweaking it would reach and maintain 46 no problem and with windows performance power profiles it reaches 50 with ease and thats with no overclocking buyer beware this thing makes some heat so get yourself a good heatsink or deal with it underclocking a lot to keep temps under control,positive
i just got into pc building there are so many chipsets on the market after 100s of hours watching everyones favorite youtubers i learned one thing a lot of chips fit the specs for what you need lol i am extremely happy with this chip coupled with my asus mother board overclocking this thing was a breeze as far as temps when overclocking im able to keep this cool with a pretty standard cpu fan no need to watercool although the look of it is awesome,positive
put in an msi z470 sli  just finished so dont know about the gaming yet just know it runs superfast and super cool water cooled with a corsair 280mm radiator of course it is freezing in this room and we all should know it can never be cooler than the air around it,positive
i bought this to upgrade my gaming pc and without even running a gaming app i can already tell the speed is much better than my i76700k things that would require 50 of my processor utilization take less that 10 on my cpu load only big down side is you have to get a new motherboard for this type of socket lga1200 or something and it requires more power from your supply so make sure you have the equipment necessary before buying,positive
the i710700k is a fantastic cpu for the money i upgraded from a i54690 locked nonk and can immediately tell a difference in a lot of games i play my gpu evga rtx 2060 is not bottlenecked by the cpu anymore dont believe all the things you read about intel 10th gen chips running hot either i have this installed in an itx case with a noctua air cooler and idle temps are between 2831c load temps dont go above 60c it also reaches 51ghz out of the box no overclocking needed,positive
got this cpu as an upgrade from a i7 7700 during 2021 it has been a huge upgrade for gaming i have never overclocked it and has been used in a deepcool netwin rgb cooler the only downside for my unit is that it has reached high but still normal temperature 82 degrees celcius,positive

disclaimer this review covers 3 main items cpu mobo ram links to the other parts are included all available at amazon for good prices youll read this review on each of the other parts as well  why did i buy it i recently built and absolute beast of a computer and kept my older one as a backup unfortunately it decided to take a dive this past week with the motherboard failing catastropically given that it was 10 years old i decided to replace the brains with something a little more modern but not overkill because i had spent a lot of money on a computer recently i was trying to keep the repair under about 400 and heres what i did  the brains intel i310100 processor 100 wwwamazoncomgpproductb086mmrw87 msi mag b460 motherboard 110 wwwamazoncomgpproductb08gxvp1dm teamgroup 16gb ddr4 60 wwwamazoncomgpproductb07wnqvbz6  these are the main parts that must be compatible and they are   i was worried about my hard drive so i went ahead and splurged on a teamgroup 1tb ssd 75  wwwamazoncomgpproductb07px2kkhm bringing my total to just under 400 i could have kept my old seagate 500gb 5400 rpm drive but i had a little extra to spend and that greatly sped up boot and wait times  for what its worth i also kept my existing antec power supply 550w that was replaced about a year ago my case and my now very old graphics card r9 380  4gb i already had a good monitor mouse and keyboard so those carried over as well  so how did it go together pretty seamlessly with just 2 little hiccups  hiccup 1 ram i did not realize the motherboard i purchased has a standard ram speed of 2666 it can get up to a max of 2933 so the ram i purchased 3200 speed cl 16 is overkill and i could have saved another 20 or so but i didnt and its my first build with teamgroup ram and im happy with it  hiccup 2 lanaudio once i got everything installed the lan would not connect to my network wired ethernet connection a little troubleshooting found out you must to upgrade the lan driver for it to work this means having another computer with internet and a flash drive likewise i went ahead and updated the audio driver and the sound was much crisper so take a moment and download all of the drivers in advance from the msi website  first power on the computer started up then turned off immediately it then restarted on its own and said the motherboard had detected changes so i needed to configure the bios entering bios found that everything was recognized so i changed the first boot device to usb flash drive and plugged in my windows 10 install flash drive and restarted  bottom line the intel i310100 is a great little chip not overclockable the msi 460 torpedo is a decent motherboard just update the lan and audio drivers that boots quickly in fact it boots so quickly i dont even see the post screen from cold to windows is easily under 30 seconds  the ram is stable at 2666 and fast enough that i probably wont even push the 2933 setting the ssd is very fast functionally almost as fast as the m2 drive i have in my beast at a savings of 2025 even with the aging r9 graphics card im easily hitting 60 fps on modern titles at 1080 in medium to high settings sometime next year when graphics card prices drop to a reasonable level ill update that and have a second gaming rig ready  overall im very happy with this setup,positive

so this is basically an i77700 the specs are nearly identical thats the beauty of intel this years i3 is an i7 from a few years back this has a couple tricks that the i7 doesnt like uhd graphics instead of just hd and being able to overclock to a slightly higher frequency but otherwise its the same chip for a fraction of the price i put this in a computer that i use mainly for surfing the web and watching videos and it doesnt let me down its super responsive and the included graphics are a nice option if you dont want to mess with a graphics card great for keeping the system low power i even tried some light gaming on this chip and it works nicely though thats not the intended purpose of this system  install was a breeze i even found the stock cooler to be less of a pain to get into place than older intel coolers that mounted the same way so ive had no complaints with this chip so far,positive

it acts as if it were an 8 core cpu i have a 9700k on my main rig and this one performs about the same  the only difference is the speed core on my 9700k is set at 51ghz but it doesnt really matter to be honest i dont think its worth to pay the extra for a speed that you wont even notice unless you are looking to buy a cpu for rendering probably you should go for higher end cpus like amd if you are purely just looking for a budget cpu for gaming this is your best option i paired this cpu with a 2070super and it gives me the 56 fps less that i get on my 9700k at ac valhalla if you are just looking for gaming get this cpu and go for a nice end gpu you can upgrade your cpu later ofcourse if you use another intel from same gen like the 10900k,positive
play video purchased the least expensive core i3 cpu just to get my z490 build upandrunning at the time lga 1200 core i7 and i9 cpus were either unavailable or horribly overpriced by resellers but now that this cpu has powered my z490 system for a while i am amazed at how good it is see bill mcdonalds excellent comments expressing the same opinion my ddr4 ram runs stable at 3600 mhz xmp and gaming at 1080p is seamless and though ive got it water cooled that is clearly overkill as it never gets hot  even under load full disclosure i am using a separate gpu graphics card instead of the integrated intel graphics still this cpu is consistently performing way beyond expectations and that is coming from an 8core amd fx8370 overclocked to 43 ghz you cant go wrong with this least expensive comet lake cpu and it will impress in both budget and highend builds,negative
i bought this cpu a couple months ago and forgot to wright a review on it so here it is this cpu has treated me super well when all threads are at 100 load the cpu runs at around 407 ghz but when one thread is being used at 100 the cpu will tend to jump around 42 or 425 ghz having 4 cores and 8 threads is really nice sense my cpu before only had 2 cores and 4 threads so it was a nice jump but the stock cooler on this cpu can get a but noisy and when the cpu is at 100 load across all cores and threads the temps dont hold up very well but i highly recommend this cpu for people that want to build a budget gaming pc or just a entertainment pc,positive

for a little over a hundred bucks this thing does a good job i was working with an amd fx 6300 for many years here are my numbers on three very different games at 1080p using an amd rx 570 as the gpu my frames are locked at 60 in most cases  monster hunter world high settings before 3045 after constant 60 with no drops  ashes of the singularity benchmark before low stress 5560 medium stress 30 high stress 20 after low stress 60 medium 50 high stress 40  minecraft fastoptifine 12 render before 60 but with annoying stuttering on loading chunks after 60 with virtually no noticeable drops while loading render can be set much higher now as well  all in all this thing does a great job for your average adventureshooter but for rts gameplay you may want to consider a stronger unit,positive
i like the core i3 processor for basic systems doing web browsing core office applications and general computing and basic photo editing these desktop core i3 processors are quad core and 8 threads which back in the early days was what a core i5 would provide such a processor is great for basic computing and when their prices are reasonable seems windows 11 security requirements have caused these to be sort after and driven prices up these should be in the 120 130 range,positive
ordered this bcuz of the price without realizing this cpu was one of a kind able to compete with modern cpu at a fraction of the cost intels first and only high performance budget cpu  it handles everything i throw at it and surprising works without bottlenecking 510 up to a gtx 2060  for that price this was a perfect purchase,positive
believe it or not this entry level 10100 is only 13 off from their flagship cpu the 10900 for just over 120 this thing is absolutely a screamer hyper threading in this series has made a huge difference in my opinion this thing seems to be holding performance with my 9600k at least till i overclock it i bought it for now since the other new intels were to expensive or not available now i use it with the new msfs 2020  am getting good fps with 4k at high settings amazing  with a gtx 1070  idles at 28 degrees c and never goes above 40 degrees c under load with a 240mm aio definitely the best deal in the lineup ,positive
i built a sff pc and i wanted something low power quiet that could drive qty 3 4k monitors this cpu worked great combined with the asrock z490 itxtb3 motherboard  it has no problem handling all my desktop apps its very responsive pc power consumption at the plug is around 24w idle with screens on and 10gb ethernet card and the fans are whisper quiet  my previous sff pc had a x470 and ryzen cpu i had tons of problems with usb compatibility and the power consumption was higher i still have a ryzen in my homelab server and for that its great but i think intel still hold the lead for low power and compatibility,positive
i was shocked to see how much performance this cpu can get you for such a low price i did a budget pc build 10 months ago and was shocked to see such a high clock for that price even now when i have upgraded to a rtx 3060 it doesnt bottle nech much at a  it is a really capable cpu to go with if it is your first pc build or you have to do a budget build,negative
after checking reviews i though this would of been on par with the 3200g i put faster ram 3600 and better mb tuf gaming b560mplus wifi 650w psu with the 10100 compared to my other pc which has a gigabyte gaa320ms2h mb and a 3200g 550w psu 3200 ram destroys this in performance load times and games i should mention i picked up the 3200g before the cpu prrices were insane for 160cad,negative
this feels way faster than any other processor i have used in the past and i can feel the difference using even midtier business grade laptops such as a lenovo i have for work with a ryzen 5 pro which feels noticeable slower on my laptop  i know is not the same but its the only thing i can compare it to i have used it for light gaming and it works great  with a graphics card of course integrated graphics sucks lol,positive
i got this at 115 its basically just an i77700 with slightly less cache  it wont even surpass the 65w tdp limit it will turbo to 41ghz allcore all the time  you wont find a better cpu currently around 100 amd has nothing that exists in reality due to supply issues  next step up is the i510400f for 50 more at 165 and again amd has nothing until 200 price point  if youre pairing this with anything rtx 3070 or lower it will be perfect,positive
i was building a surprise system for an old friend whose current pc was quite old he dose basic computing tasks and did not require a mega machine that said i paired this cpu with 16 gb of memory and an m2 nvme drive yes a bit overkill for basic tasks but his son likes to do some light gaming so i made sure he had head room to handle it the pc booted consistently under 19 seconds and performs very well i would definitely buy this again,positive
for 100 you really cant beat the value of this cpu right now for light gaming and a low build its perfectly fine integrated graphics arent bad and really surprised me actually ive run halo rocket league fortnite and a couple more on low settings without issue doesnt get too warm during heavy use either the included cooler is a big plus and is super easy to install just pop some tabs in ive had it running for about a month now with no issues would recommend,positive
this has 25 more speed on my old cpu and works fine for light video production and running virtual machineswith on board graphics it saved buying an extra card power consumption and heat were low and it flys when running pop os now my only issues was that it got a panic installing qubes  will update when i try out haiku os it runs several vms at the same time without hanging or slowing for a hundred bucks its an absolute steal,positive
the i510400 crushes the i310100 in real world use for only a little more money if you are going to do anything thats cpu intensive like gaming photovideo editing content creation etc spend a few more dollars for the i510400 or i511400 which is even better  if you just want a cheap cpu for your lga1200 motherboard consider the much less expensive g5905 or similar intel is sadly reducing their offerings for desktop cpus the 13th gen series doesnt even have an i3 let alone less expensive options at least available retail for diy builds but imho this chip is an albatross i only bought it due to supply issues as nothing less expensive was in stock i needed a 10th cpu to boot my motherboard to upgrade the bios to support 11th gen a common intel catch 22 issue i should have just bought something used,negative
im not a gamer i edit and create videos i paired this cpu with an asus prime b560ma motherboard im using the cooling fan that came with it so far no problems with any excessive heat it does get 111f or 44c at the highest load so far very fast and nice budget build ken s,positive
seems like the people thinks this processor isnt worth but they are very wrong this is probably the best cheap proccesor in the world and better if you compare vs amd version ryzen 3 3000g may be i5 10th is worthiest than this but this is very great for a cheap build,positive
stock cooler cools it fine,positive
i used this processor on a build for my daughter i put it on an msi z490 a pro main board w 16 gb of memory and doing that put me in the 7 second club push the power button and 7 seconds later the machine is booted another 2 seconds and youre on the internet so no bottle necks are likely considering that tis not a high end processor it is impressive,positive
if you are looking for a nice budget cpu for gaming and everyday use look no further intel has upped their game with this cpu and it performs far better than i expected it is highly recommended,positive
muy bueno era para mi hermano de 10 aos y cumple su funcion de buena manera,neutral

this works really well for basic home use web browsing and a plex media server i couldnt comment on its use in gaming but general purpose processing it does well,positive
after options were sold out from the other competing brand i was able to find the 10100 on sale for a great price it wasnt my first choice but after building a system with it i am quite happy with the results it runs cool and efficiently even with the stock heatsink i would recommend this cpu to anyone looking for an entry level productivity or gaming machine when paired with a discreet graphics card,positive
great processor was not expecting the performance from a 4 core8 thread running at 36g rated 4 stars because of packaging i received the cpu in a thin bag with no bubble wrap or any protection inside luckily the cpu and box was undamaged would of received 5 stars with better shipping materials,positive
great processor for low to mid end gaming and on a budget best for 1080p gaming on medium to high settings for most games when paired with something like a gtx 1060 got it for a good price with the bundle options as more than likely you need a motherboard to go with it just know with most systems the ram will be limited to 2666 mhz speed,positive
this is the best performing cpu ive had in this price range if your looking for a cheap cpu to put with a gtx 1650 look no more this cpu crushes ryzen 3 3200g and ryzen 3 3100 and comes mighty close in gaming to the ryzen 3 3300x the cpu runs cool its 36 ghz base speed makes this chip super snappy gaming and general use a rating all the way ,positive
upgraded from an i3 8100 and it is a world of difference  i play cs  go and valorant  i went for 60 percent usage to 25 percent  i wanted to get a ryzen 3600  but at 105 dollars and a b460 board it was under 180 dollars  easy install and set up  benchmarks show it on par with i74770 ,positive
llego relativamente rapido  tiene un buen precio aunque la pedi con el combo de la placa que aun se demora se podria decir que literalmente es un i7 7700 solo que un poco mejor ademas si comparamos su competencia directa el ryze 3 3100 o el 3300x podemos decir que primero es mas barato y segundo hay stock ,neutral
powerful little processor for the amount of money i spent on it replaced my i36100 with this using it right now to type this review plays most of my current lineup of games although in full disclosure i havent tested it out on the most recent batch watchdogs legion or any other recent aaa plays assassins creed syndicate ok and that games a hot mess,positive

not sure what to say my boyfriends friend told me to buy this for my pc so i would recommend it it got here safely and neatly packaged ,positive
an excellent product for  110 being a little better than the i77700 cpu that costs almost 3 times as much i bought this product because the lga1200 socket goint to be compatible with intels 11th generation in 2021 and then i will be buying an i511th by the end of next year,positive
you wont be smashing the latest games or solving any unsolved math theorems with this cpu its a good starter though,positive

my last i3 was the gen 9 so jumping to 12 and seeing that its a pinless cpu pins are on the motherboard was a big surprise and a bit of a relief overall i am damned happy with the upgrade its not a top end gaming pc but its more than enough i dont do competitive fps games rtx lighting is obnoxious as well as motion blur  basically purty graphics and good performance is what matters  that said the one complaint i do have falls on amazon youd think that a processor would be packaged in a box with some protective wrapping right nope paper bag with no bubble wrap that also arrived torn the fact that the ram didnt fall out the hole and that the cpu works fine is a relief,positive

absolute beast for 100 that competes well and can perform along side even a 3060ti or rx 6700xt only thing id say is use your own thermal paste the paste that comes with the fan is sub par,positive
im sure im stealing someone else description but it is such a great entry level cpu im just using it for gaming which an rx 6600 xt and not had any cpu bottlenecking at all the chip runs light on power temps have been fine way less than than i used to get on an i5 in the laptop im only running 1 fan on the case and the room can often get to 2628 c in summer but thermals are still great very happy and would highly recommend also amazon was super quick on delivery,positive

i used this to build a pc for my wife the performance on this cpu depending on supporting hardware matches or exceeds many cpus available at both similar and higher price points if you are truly going for a budget build it is hard to beat this below 100  i built her system with 16gb of ddr4 3200 ram and an rx 6600 for the gpu and she has no problem running anything either gaming or productivity  i dont recommend going as cheap as you can on the motherboard if you get this though the performance on this can be great but you have to get supporting hardware to maximize it,positive

amazing cpu for less then 100 i put this into my build and it is very fast i can play any game with no issues paired with rx 6600 i would recommend upgrading to a better cpu in a year or 2 like a 12400f but it isnt necessary if u are building a budget build then this is an awesome choice tho it will slowdown on you in a year or 2 so thats why im gonna upgrade to 12400f soon,positive

this cpu is part of my upgrade from socket 1200 to socket 1700 this cpu is noticeably faster than the one it replaced a 10th generation intel i5 this cpu runs very cool and provides plenty of power for my everyday computing needs which do not include gaming my system currently runs the zorin os linux smoothly and efficiently with temperatures sometimes under 30 degrees just remember that with this cpu you need a graphics card as the chip does not have that component it is a nice touch that this cpu is compatible with either ddr4 or ddr5 memory just check the standards for the motherboard you intend to purchase best of luck with building your own desktop,positive

i didnt expect much from an i3 but once again i was blinded by the label this product holds the price to performance of a console killer its single core power is up there with the ryzen 7000 series processors supporting ddr5 ram at only 90 dollars with the cooler assuming your average cooler is about 10 dollars you really cant go wrong with an 84 dollar cpu capable of 500 fps on minecraft 300 fps on valorant etc  i will say though a quad core cpu in 2023 is a bit questionable since youll have extra issues streaming and recording games the cache is also pretty low for this cpu but you really cant hate too much on a 90 dollar cpu at this magnitude of performance  overall solid cpu more than i need for games and editing dont be blinded by the i3 label it performs up there with ryzen cpus and 10th gen i7s,negative

this has enough power to play all games i dont have a single one in my library that uses more than 50 of this cpu it plays gta 5 satisfactory far cry 6 cities skylines and it can even play uebs 2 with 4 million ai enemies ive only ever seen this hit 100 on benchmarks  just because its an i3 dont think its weak 12th gen i3s are more powerful than i7s of older generations  dont buy the i5 i7 or i9 this is more than enough  update 5252024 this processor is still going strong and can still play modern games runs sons of the forest like a champ never hitting 100 unfortunately i have found 2 games this struggles to run star citizen and grey zone warfare it is 100 the entire time on both of these games grey zone warfare can still run at 80fps on ultra settings at 4k but star citizen bogs down so bad its almost unplayable but still even in 2024 its still a great buy and i still recommend,positive
the price this little quad core comes in at really is incredible sure its quad core but this is not the i3 of the past well kinda is but you know what i mean 43ghz single core with 8 threads means this think is a mini gaming beast it can do 1440p gaming with capable card of course and i have been doing just that the only reason i will be moving on from it is for the 6 core i3 in 14th gen best believe though i will be making another inexpensive pc with this when i upgrade i have a spare 5500xt that should make for a quality 1080p second machine for when i visit home to my moms 55 stars,positive

the i310100fs main flaw was the small cache size of 6mo this one has 12mo which is a massive uplift in stability when gaming and speaking of gaming the cooler it comes with  idk why but one of the 4 push pins never wanted to be fully pushed  well playing gta 5 at 120fps led me to 8592 degrees on the cpu sorry but this is not a laptop this is unacceptableget ready for a cooler upgrade i cant believe they even give this but twice bigger for the i9s oof struggling under 35w load thats pathetic,negative
this cpu comes with a cooler and a diagram showing how to attach said cooler however the diagram showed use of a bracket on the motherboard and it did not have one in the box luckily i planned on using my own cooler anyways however i cant overlook that as it would be frustrating to anyone relying on their box cooler to be ready to go,positive

id like to state that this isnt a high end part this is an 80 cpu with only 4 cores and 8threads but those are incredibly fast cores and pairing it with an appropriate gpu like the 3060 6600xt and possibly up to the 3070 6750xt and 6800xt at 1440p or higher will run those gpus without an issue anything higher and youd already be spending a lot for the rest of the system so just get a better cpu,positive

it is working almost same as my 10 yr old dell xps laptop swapped with a sata ssd and i7 second gen processor i dont know whats improved but its doing its job i guess in my 2 weeks of usage i have seen its temprature rised above 80c once wasnt expecting that from current refined and powerful generations i am using liquid cooling on top of this and yet it hit 80c what i was doing when that happened was trying to open a game and one thing that i missed was to disable the integrated graphics because i have dedicated gpu it was just for a moment the cpu was used during the game launch and after it started using the gpu but until that switch happened under less than a minute of cpu usage it reached to 80c i mean since these are premium products there should be some protection layers blocking such usages and close the programs instead rather than hitting its performance  but anyways i disabled the integrated device and then its all smooth everything normal except for that one instance explained above parallel processing is still shitty though with windows os same kind of processors on mac before apple silicon came in were working more efficiently so i guess its prob with windows os but not processors,positive

my first review ever intel has finally acknowledged this issue search regarding reports of 13th14th gen unlocked desktop users experiencing stability issues on google  for me worked great for about a month then slowly started experiencing stability issues games would crash and get an occasional blue screen after about 6 months there were noticeable stability issues with many games unable to boot past main menu causing blue screen on launch or experiencing frequent crashes friends in separate friend groups would always comment on my computer issues showing bugs and crashes that have no apparent causes  after a year my pc can only run super smash brothers melee with stability and even chrome tabs are crashing now discord has to be run on chrome because the app crashes every 10 seconds i cant play any games i had dedicated tens of hours into investigating only to realize its been the cpu all along i also had to upgrade my motherboard to accommodate this cpu and now i have to investigate if this cpu has caused irreparable damage to the motherboard i expect intel will be facing heavy financial losses due to influx of warranties as the issues become more and more public  please look up intel 13th and 14th gen stability for more info or intel raptor lake stability on google for further cases unacceptable for a company worth over 100b to push out a product like this,positive
a real beast overkill most of the time but awesome when you need it unfortunately not all software can take advantage of so many cores but at least the impressive 58 ghz is a consolation prize when only one or two cores are used making the task take less time than other processors would need,positive

like the title says and all the reviews say this thing is a beast make sure you have a good cooling solution lined up even without overclocking this puppy will handle anything ive thrown at it with ease but like all the reviews you see online say it puts out some serious heat ive had it for about 45months now before it started cooling off outside i was have to crank the ac to keep my gaming room cool and now that its cooling off outside 3040 f at night i have blocked off the vents in the room to prevent any additional heat this thing paired with a rtx 4090 keeps this room plenty warm enough for me so on the plus side ill be saving on heating this winter,positive

so first things first this is a genuinely powerful cpu thats been able to handle basically every task that ive thrown at it it runs demanding tasks like encoding and gaming with ease  now with that out of the way thermals this thing gets hot and i mean really hot if youre going with air cooling i strongly recommend a double tower sixeight pipe air cooler like the corsair a115 or a cooler master ma824 if you are going the aio route anything less than a 360mm aio will under perform for that go with any 360mm aio from any brand of your choice if you have the space go with a 420mm aio for the best results  finally there has been recent reports of cpu degradation and instability when using this cpu i am using this with an asus rog strix z790h motherboard and it basically juiced the cpu like no tomorrow until i applied intels power settings for this cpu this likely is the cause of the degradation be sure to check intels website for recommended power settings also check your motherboard vendor for any bios updates as intel has confirmed that many motherboard vendors are running the i9 13900k cpu out of intels specifications  in conclusion heres my personal experience the cpu functions but i can not use asus ai overclocking feature as i get a bsod with the clockwatchdogtimeout error and apps will randomly crash you probably shouldnt use any ai assisted overclocking feature if you can help it even running this at stock there is still a substantial amount of performance in this cpu if you have an older rig and are looking to upgrade your cpu i would just wait for meteorlake or just go with amd  final note i am not using a contact frame on my motherboard for my cpu,positive

this cpu unit is a beast upgraded from a i7 8700kthe improvement was huge doubled my fps in wow and there is no more lag nevertheless after 6 months of regular use it started failingmany kernel errors until it finally became useless i could somehow return it to intel from per to usa great support outside usbut such a complex and expensive unit cannot fail that quickly without heavy usage at least in my opinion,negative
i got this and a new ddr5 motherboard with z690 chipset it didnt boot when i set it all up it turns out the z690 needs a bios update to work with this cpu luckily i had an older i7 that worked on this motherboard i dropped it in and it booted then i did the bios update after that it boots this cpu just fine before this i was a diehard amd supporter i had 5950x with 16 cores 32 threads and 72mb of cache but it just doesnt compete with this i9 i havent tried the 7950x but i read that the pcores just blow away the amd cores even with less cache the setup of 8 performance cores and 16 efficiency cores just works it stays much cooler than earlier i9s and the amd i use a water cooler but its not required nothing slows this down when paired with ddr5 i wish the amd was better i like the company more but i want the best of the best and as of today there is nothing better than this available if you game or do graphics or anything on your pc this is the cpu for you it will not disappoint  a word on the x790 chipset you would think they will have better performance because they are newer they dont they will work with the i9 no matter what while the z690 might need a bios update they have one more usb port but otherwise there is no benefit to getting z790 and they cost a lot more so if you have the ability to use an older cpu to flash the bios or find one that is new enough that it doesnt need the update this cpu will be great,positive
i really like this cpu and it has worked well for my needs many had the issue of overheating throttling and even bending in some instances i have not experienced any of this since i knew exactly what settings needed adjusted in the bios to keep this monster cpu running cool it seems that motherboard manufacturers tend to turn these up way past their limits by default and that was what caused all the issues all you need to to is look up the specs for your cpu and setup the bios of your motherboard accordingly  i am using the aorus waterforce x 280 with artic mx6 thermal paste just in case you are curious this has also been installed on the gigabyte z790 aorus elite ax motherboard  as long as you set this up correctly you will not have any issues and will get a great performing cpu,positive
i did end up returning it because of a motherboard issue i do have a 12900k and many other types and they all perform as expected i would recommend intel processors to those looking for something for general all around performance as the 14900k and 13900k are basically the same i would say get this one unless you can find the 14900k for the same price,positive

using phantek glacier d30 360mm cooler during heavy stress load it gets around 8284c just gaming in heavy modded skyrim ffxiv and total warhammer 3 stays around 5055c  those complaining about temps higher than that while just gaming likely do not have their cooler mounted properly or too low end of a cooler  make sure coolers plastic film is removed from metal block if it has that apply plenty of thermal paste if cooler doesnt come pre applied with any and evenly screw on the mounting screws to keep pressure as evenly as possible till all are set,positive
when it comes to going over the top for a pc upgrade this cpu is the undisputed heavyweight champion i too dabble in video editing 3d modeling and an array of demanding tasks and let me tell you this powerhouse just devours them with sheer gusto paired with a kraken water cooler it operates like a welloiled machine showing absolutely no signs of throttling even under the most intense workloads and as for those socalled cpuintensive games well they might as well be childs play for this beast if youre seeking the best of the best look no further  this cpu is the crown jewel in the kingdom of processors and its here to make your computing dreams come true its not just toptier its top of the world and it laughs in the face of anything you throw its way a true marvel of technology thats worth every penny,positive
this processor is a beast especially paired with gtx 4090 graphics card i can edit videos and play games both at 4k settings together no problem and it doesnt generate that much heat either i previously had a 2080ti paired with 6900k and was very happy with it until everyone was transitioning to 4k so sadly i had to retire my old build just a heads up to anyone who plans to pair 13900k with 4090 dont be a smartass and try to put it in small case you will regret it later i personally recommend big case with high airflow like fractal design torrent mid size atx but if you dont want to spend too much money on graphics card and happy with getting something like 4060 then you can get the nano version of fractal torrent good luck gamers and editors just remember if gaming is the only thing you do then no point spending this much just go a step down on processor amd processors are better if gaming is the only thing you do,positive
this was bought for my sons custom build gaming computer only a few weeks in but i havent heard any complaints from him,negative
its so good and that makes sense since its top of the line right now imagine that going from my 9900k to this was like a spiritual enlightening but also i must add this is totally unnecessary unless youll be working with heavy loads unreal engine 4k video editing and streaming 4k gaming or anything that requires overclocking  buying this bad boy will future proof your computer for now but there are very few people who need this kind of cpu if youre shopping for your build right now and considering this if its in the budget and you want something thatll handle literally whatever you want then yes this is great but just remember whatever you want might not be as intense as this thing accounts for  now that ive warned you about not needing this let me just say how happy i am that i got it i do a lot of 4k editing and streaming and there is no issue runs smoothly and efficiently does get hot though if youve got a good cooler on this then youll be good to go for a long time,positive
installation is easy it does run a little hot so you need a good cooler i use a dedicated allinone water solution from corsair and the package temp never exceeds 75,positive
love this cpu super fast only complant is the imc of my chip sucks cant get over 7000mhz stable but thats fine i swapped my 7200mhz 32gb kit out for 64gb 6400mh z kit and tightend the timing great gaming cpu fast at all tasks ill probably stay with intel for now unless amds cpus get an equivalent transcode to intels integrated graphics,positive
as per benchmarks this cpu performs way better than amd 7950x3d although you will just get 34 frames higher while gaming in amd 7950x3d cpu but whats the point intel is still leading in single core score power consumption is almost same intel is apple and amd is android end of story,positive

this thing puts enough heat out to power a thermal generator and i really am not kidding water cooling only unless you want to melt your board or destroy the high dollar part i would also recommend a large radiator too 3 fan coverage this thing is an excellent space heater  outclasses thread ripper by almost double its paces per benchmarking in multicore handles everything i throw at it then yawns at me as if it was boring and mediocre work  simply put leader of the pack right now and handles literally anything ive tried to hit it with even running multiple games at once when combined with a good gpu naturally  i have zero complaints ive learned to hate a lot of intel items over the years but this truly is a marvel,negative
i bought two of these from amazon after one from another vendor failed to post both worked the first time do you need 24 cores for games most games use 4 or 6 cores max so probably not video editing can benefit from the extra cores intel supports xmp extreme memory profile and this processor is unlocked it can be overclocked overclocking increases the power consumption and heat therefore one needs a robust cooling solution overclocking can void your warranty which is strange since intel allows and even promotes overclocking with the intel extreme tuning utility i have the nzxt kraken x 73 rgb liquid cooler with the nzxt cam software you can see the cpu and gpu temperatures and control the fan speeds reducing the risk of damaging the processor while idling at 55 ghz the cpu temperature is 30 c under a 50 load or overclocked the temperatures are below 60 c pros good for video editing cons a bit pricey for a gaming computer dont overclock without monitoring temperatures to keep below 60 c,positive
excellent processor it is a beast in gaming and in productivity for the price i believe is unrivaled beware that you should separately buy a cpu cooler because it does not come with one also beware that most motherboards nowadays put no restraints to this processor in the bios so they let it draw unlimited power and with that comes a very hot temperature limit for example im using an 360mm aio cooler and with the stock motherboard settings of my aorus elite ax when running cinebench it reaches 100c within 12 seconds of starting of course this temperature is only seen in stress tests and never during games there the max ive seen the cpu get is 67c but is something to be aware of all in all happy with this beast,positive
run smoothly and cool great value,positive
probably more than what i need for gaming maybe i should have gotten a 13700k instead to run a little cooler this gets hot on my dark rock pro 4 i want to get a 360mm aio to help cool this i ruined a motherboard trying to use a contact frame afraid to use one again contact frame went in the trash so another motherboard would not using the stock cpu holder loading mechanism,positive
very gooood,positive
if it have the money to spare and want a processor thatll last you at least 5 years and are a power user like i am its a good choice but most people say the advantages over the 13700k arent worth it to most users  if youre just using the pc as a highend gaming rig an i713700k is more than enough even with a 4090 gpu this processor is designed to benefit more advanced users so id save the 150 and get the cheaper 13700k also this processor is notoriously hot so a beefy noctua air cooler or preferably a 280mm watercooler aio is necessary especially for overclocking,positive
it works as intended needed the upgrade,neutral
if youre going with an aio get a 360mm cooler i tried using a 240mm and it just wasnt enough to cool the cpu during some starfield that out of the way this thing is seriously impressive even with how un optimized some of these new games are i have never seen anything use it beyond 80 other than some cpu specific tasks,positive
it worked fine for 6 months then i start running into error code 0xc0000005 with lots of various applications in windows 11 i figure it was after an update and they turned on some security thing and i dissabled all the security stuff and still running into issues i reset the os still issues i do a fresh clean install still issues i try replacing the memory still issues i try installing win 11 with a different boot installer still issues i try windows 10 still issues i try reinstalling it 2 more times still the same issue  i decide to go to micro center to have them diagnose the issue while i am there their windows 10 install crashes with the same error code they take it in and in 2 days message me saying its the cpu they tried the cpu in a different motherboard and the issue still shows up so i go and pick up the machine  i try to file a warrenty claim with intel but their login system was broken for a week so i had to chat with a support person we spend 1 hour typing about the issue i send him screenshots of the cpu itself the text from microcenter the recepit from amazon screenshot of the bios showing all my hardware information a screenshot of the recepit from microcenter a screenshot of the error code  i wait a week or so i can finally log into intel website and i dont see a support ticket i open up chat again i tell them my ticket and they tell me that it wasnt assigned to an email address they assign it and forward the support response to me  and the response says they cant contact microcenter to confirm it and that its not a cpu issue anyways because that code is due to an os issue  an os issue i ask them to reiterate their point because if its an os issue that means they dont believe me and microcenter i also pointed out again that i have installed windows 10 and 11 at least 5 times and they respond with i need documentation from microcenter so they dont believe me and they believe this is an os issue still  it has been 11 days and they wont move forward unless i send the documentation from micro center now  works great but hope you never have to file a warrenty claim because its going to take at least a month and thats if your lucky,positive
i913900k or kf fast install onto a supermicro board x13saef with server memory with ipmi for remote access or an asus board such as z690f with ddr5 where you can buy an ipmi attachment and it throttles rather than crashes when it overheats or just for gaming and office use this cpu beats everything else to date buy one now and if you have an i912900k or kf sell it pay attention to the necessary new bios install not one crash to date but occasional throttling down when stressed as cpu temperature gets too high occurs now and again but not very often and sure stronger air fan or water cool fix that if it bothers you same thing happens on my more than twice the price thread ripper 3970x and not a big deal this a server class cpu,positive
the intel core i913900k desktop processor is just a fantastic superfast processor that does have 24 cores when needed for heavy applications get yourself an aio cooler like the artic freezer ii 360 size and youre all set no real need to overclock this cpu it also works great for heavy applications and gaming has plenty of fast l 3 cache on die so theres no delay or speed issues it also runs my team group ddr 5 7800mhz ram with no problem on my maximus z790 hero chipset motherboard wanted to get the evga z790 kingpin motherboard but it sells out very fast within minutes great cpu and im very happy that ive bought the intel 13900k hands down this will be a great for 56 years to easily and maybe longer,positive

extremely fast processor moved from a 12900kf much faster ram clocks without the issues the 12900kf was giving me  i have been using the processor for a while now with no issues and great thermals on a watercooled system the processor stability has been rock solid even with a bios updated 12th gen motherboard,positive

it comes with cpu only in a box  without a fan so you need to buy an lga1700 fan support it running quit good but not the greatest yet for rtx 4090 4080 because the gpu usage will reach 9598 it doesnt go 99 all the times so theres a bit of cpu bottleneck even at 4k resolution  it gets even worst cpu bottleneck in 1440p or 1080p so i think the core i914900k or 15900k will get the job done no cpu bottleneck i used this with asus rog strix z790f gaming ddr5 it works great thanks to the seller is trusted,positive
took me forever to figure this out but i cant reach rated speeds on my 13900k due to throttling  sp 11188  103 cooling 170  when the throttle happens both pcores and ecores drop causing performance hits in normal tasks as well as games asus motherboard at default settings attempts to send extreme amounts of voltage to the cpu 14 in order to reach boost rating no xmp  this has literally been the most difficult processor to reign in heat ive had to deal with in my 30 years of computing amd is starting to look good i guess which is why i switched to and have remained with intel for 20 years amd ran hot back in the day apparently even the 14900ks are having issues  its power hungry its hot not enough surface area to cool appropriately without risking your warranty  literally every solution ive seen involves doing things intel recommends against  intel some help would be appreciated,positive
this cpu is insanely fast for both gaming but also productivity right out of the box with default settings my 13900k scored over 40000 points on cinebench r23 multicore test for max power uses like cinebench or blender it pushes my 360mm aio cooler to its limits but for gaming it rarely gets above 60c i use a thermalrite contact frame and thermal grizzly kryonaut paste for max cooling effectiveness overall very pleased with my purchase and plan to use this cpu for many years to come,positive

i use it for computation not games with a noctua d15 1 fan on all cores some openmp stuff i wrote it goes 51ghz on the performance cores and 41ghz on the efficient cores in a 23c corner of a room the temp moves between 90 and 100 c how i handle that emotionally is to have enough in my bank account to get a 13600k overnighted having said that ive been at it for a little over a month and there has not been a glitch paired with an asus strix 790e,negative
this processor produces too much heat forget obout overclocking i tried intel utility in overclocked mode the processor consumes over 300w and heats to over 100c even with the best cooler without overclocking it consumes about 250w and heats up to 89c under the full load which is acceptable,positive

i recently got my hands on the intel core i912900k desktop processor and i have to say i am blown away by its performance this processor is an absolute powerhouse with 16 cores 8p8e and speeds of up to 52 ghz its also unlocked which means i can push its limits even further if i want to  installing the processor was easy enough although i did have to make sure my motherboard was compatible with the lga1700 socket and 600 series chipset once i had everything set up i fired up my favorite games and applications to see how the processor would perform  the results were nothing short of impressive the i912900k chewed through every task i threw at it with ease from demanding video editing software to the latest aaa games i was able to multitask without any lag or slowdowns and my system felt incredibly responsive and snappy  the processor also runs surprisingly cool even under heavy load i did notice a slight increase in power consumption compared to my old processor but its a small price to pay for the sheer performance boost  overall i am extremely satisfied with the intel core i912900k desktop processor if youre a power user or a gamer who demands the best performance this processor is definitely worth considering its not cheap but in my opinion its worth every penny for the sheer power and speed it delivers,positive

this isnt the processor for everyone but it is very fast the individual cores arent significantly different from those in the 13th generation i7 but if you have a need for a lot of parallel processing then this may be the processor for you i do software development which it doesnt help 99 of the time gaming which it helps a little and occasionally transcoding large amounts of video and music during transcoding it helps a huge amount i have over 300gb of flac audio files that i ripped from my cd collection i never buy mp3s i wanted to have that on my phone but i didnt want to carry it at full rate because i cant tell the difference in the car so i transcoded it i had done that once before and it took more than a day on a five year old ryzen 7 this machine took around 30 minutes 3040 times faster at work the optics team which uses ray tracing software to design optical telescopes and laser focusing lenses uses i9s in preference to xeons the xeons might be faster under some circumstances but the machines are hugely expensive so the i9s are much better for price performance would i buy it again id probably buy the 13th generation but if i had any sense id just get the 13th gen i7,positive

this thing never goes over 15 percent usage and most games its actually using 04 percent even on escape from tarkov at max settings 4k 140 fps its using 4 percent at max and usually is at 01 percent i dont know if its my computer reading an error but i use a few apps to check including the task manager tab i use an nzxt aio and the temps on this thing are under 20 idle and when im gaming on any game it never goes over 45 and usually is in the low 30s i tried wow classic retail cyberpunk spiderman  and regularly play escape from tarkov and all at 4k max settings and this thing just stays cool and and low usage my gpu barely works as i have a 3090 ti my gpu is usually at usage 4050 percent at max 60 percent and stays cool so i dont think anything is bottle necking  my old computer has an i5 and i have a laptop with an i7 and when i am gaming they are usually at 90 percent usage even my friend with the amd 5800x3d was getting at least 30percent usage for aaa games this is the first computer ive built where im actually not even worried about the cpu for how cool it runs im really shocked on how good its performance is definitely recommend,positive

had a 11900k prior to this one and as fast as it was even being overclocked to 53 ghz  the 12900k is just simply better put a minor overclock to 52 ghz and its been so nice p cores are freed up to do what theyre supposed to do e cores do the chores was hot at first before undervolting but now thats done and temps are high 70s with a 360 mm corsair aio paired up with a z690 from msi and a rtx 3090 its just the perfect combo 12900k is completely free to do the data processing for the game and 3090 handles the graphics side in all my triple a titles without needing to borrow from the system memory at all  needing to pull data through the processor resizable bar enabled and its been awesome was worth every penny,positive

so far this thing is great i upgraded from the 9900k and this has been a noticeable difference im still in the process of updating drivers and reinstalling some software i havent done any overclocking so the cinebench score and temps are straight stock settings after seeing all the info on how hot this thing can get i added the thermalright contact frame it was a breeze to install i watched the gamers nexus video about this frame and followed their directions for the motherboard i went with a msi z690 mpg edge wifi ddr4 so i could reuse my current ram i had to order a lga 1700 bracket for the nzxt kraken x73 aio i ordered both the frame and the lga 1700 mount from amazon and both arrived fast and were exactly what i needed so far my temps are staying in the general range of my 9900k im planning to do a little gaming this week with it so ill have a chance to see how it does under my daily use i also do a bit of premiere and after effects so im looking forward to seeing how it works there as well overall this is probably way more processor than i need i was still able to do what i needed to do with the 9900k i built the 9900k in 2020 during the height of the astronomically high pc price wave i ended up getting this processor for about 100 less than i paid for the 9900k two years ago so the pricetoperformance upgrade for me was a no brainer if you want a fast processor at a reasonably decent price this is a great one to get just be aware you will need to pay attention to your cooling,positive
it took me less than 15 minutes to take out my current 1700 series cpu i7 12700k and add in this new one removed the aio cooler cleaned off the thermal paste applied new past after inserting and wala its up and running like a champ im not a gamer so yes i understand its not a huge bump in performance for those applications video editing is another story,negative
are usually go for the best products and it was a mistake for my first pc build i chose this chip and i didnt know it runs that hot i built my pc i had enough fans but i had a 240 mm radiator i want a micro center and had to get a 360 mm cooler from the pool the temps were at 89 to 92c after the deep cool aio under stress test and bench testing the temp stay under 60c  other than that i game hard on it and stream and the cpu usage never goes past 30 its pretty overkill but thats how i like my pc,positive
purchased this for my new rig as opposed to an i7 based on price point at time of purchase this was actually cheaper than the i7 paired with rtx 4060ti 8gb  no regrets this can handle anything i throw at it without issue gaming wise and never goes above 5055c not overclocked and cooled with 240mm aio from corsair idles around 3233c very responsive with plenty of clearance if i ever want to oc this guy heat was a concern after reading reviews and only having a 240mm radiator sitting over a 4060ti but no issues  heat or performance at all  great time to buy with new gen just arriving recently,positive
if someone ever asks you what is a gpu bottleneck buy them a 12900k lmao  its so good,positive
purchased this cpu to finally upgrade my tired 8086k that i have had for close to 4 years now and considering i also own a 3090 i was lucky enough to get last year it was time paired with said gpu and a msi tomahawk z690 with a noctua nhd15 chromax black cooler this cpu runs complete marathons around my old 8086k certain games that would fully saturate my 8086k while also getting notifications from something like discord would introduce very bad stutter however those are completely eliminated with the 12900k temps are high when im doing full resolution photo renders from my dji air 2s or sony a6400 or straight up benchmarking but that is expected and im not one to sweat about 8090c temps but if you are i would recommend the 12700k5900x as they both run cooler and draw less wattage however in gaming with multiple different firefox tabs and discordtelegram open it never even touches 70c so your experience may vary depending on what type of work load you are doing make sure that if you do have a high powered gpu that you also have a high output power supply with a high efficiency rating as well as my system can suck north of 600750w full tilt my power supply being a 1200w platinum evga that doesnt break a sweat under full load,positive

i only used laptops up to this point and this is my first pc build however i got this processor specifically for workstation class computation and high performance gaming the core i912900k is blazing fast and uses very little watts for gaming mostly hovering around 65w80w in the games i have played so far it renders 3d projects at such a speed i hardly have time to do something else before it is complete which is a great change of pace i would say the core i512600k is better geared for gaming and this is much more geared towards production or enthusiast class gaming i highly recommend this processor or anything in the 12th gen alder lake family  full system specs asus prime z690a noctua nhd15 chromax black intel core i912900k 52ghz nvidia rtx a5000 24gb ecc gskill trident z5 rgb 32gb 5600mhz samsung 980 pro 2tb m2 nvme samsung 970 evo plus 2tb m2 nvme samsung 970 evo plus 2tb m2 nvme samsung 970 evo plus 2tb m2 nvme evga super nova g5 850w 80 plus gold fractal torrent gray eatx mid tower case,positive
i bought this instead of the 12th gen i7 anticipating future demand for more cores there is a price difference to consider as many know more cores doesnt necessarily mean better games only use a max of 6 cores though it may vary from game to game if you just want to game buy the i7 series my 4790k had served me so well its still my backup on my old mobo its been at least 5 years since i bought ol reliable shes been through rough seas it was time for her to rest easy  for the i9 in terms of gaming performance only cpu heavy games like rts games will see any benefit multitasking also sees benefit though thats limited to the hard drive its working off of still i expect great things in the far future  the packaging is a keeper to be sure too,positive

its great im using 13900k but wanted a better cpu for my 2nd pc and its great especially for compute tasks and multithreaded workloads the raptor lake and forthcoming will of course be better but if you need the best alder lake cpu and can find a decent deal it wont let you down im able to cool it efficiently with a noctua n14 single stack single fan setup and it works great,positive

many cores able to run multiple virtual machines with unnoticeable slowdown to other functions stays at 13 when playing games paired with a 3070 may upgrade to 13th gen later but i really cant complain in terms of performance only have a dualfandual heatsink cpu cooler and it stays below 60 celsius at all times rests at about 30,positive
the 12900k can be hard to justify the 12700k is around twothirds the cost and the difference in performance is only a few percent furthermore you can get away with a moderate cooling solution on the 12700k whereas the 12900k really requires a top of the line cooler which will set you back even more even while using the nhd15 cpu cooler i decided to underclock the 12900k a little bit in order to keep thermals in check bringing the performance nearer to the 12700k given the option to do it over i would have just gone with a 12700k and saved myself about 250,positive
this cpu is power hungry under load but in games the cpu is fast this also works fine for workstation workloads but this shines in gaming for sure also if you have the cooling this cpu can be clocked even higher for better performance but for this you will need a decent cpu cooler,positive
great price easy to install,positive
ive put together a few systems and run some retail 12900k chips so far and the 12900k is by far an amazingly fast cpu  unfortunately this one i ordered from amazon came already opened as soon as i opened the shipping box i could tell it had been opened before the edge was uneven and the label crease was loose i put my xacto knife down which is what you need or something similar to open these as the label is there for a reason and with just the gentlest of pressure the label peeled away from the center where someone oh so nicely had finely cut the label horizontal to make it easy to fold one side back over the other and with just a quick once over it looked almost normal  if i hadnt opened a few of them already with intels fancy new packaging i probably would not have noticed but the way the packaging normally is it is very precise tight even lines and you will not be easily or gently opening it up with a simple light finger pry  my biggest fear was there wasnt going to be a cpu in there at all but luckily the right cpu was in there that matched the container batch but if something is sold as new i dont do open boxes  make sure to check your packages before opening the seal should be nice and tight and straight the edges of the back flap should be firm and secure against the other flap and the bottom lineedges should be even and exacting  give a gentle pull on each corner of the box where the label keeps it sealed to make sure it hasnt been altered or tampered with it should be very firm and unable to just pull open easily look at the condition of the box itself around that area and even the gold disk inside  fresh brand new i9 12900ks are very pristine and boxed with precision  still they are fantastic processors overall and a worthy upgrade from 10th and 11th gen,positive

now has a thin film over it dont know how it receives electricity and signal from the socket on the motherboard probably similar to wireless charging but at least it protects the pins so less likely to damage them while handling the cpu during the build after all cpu is the most or second mot expensive component in a pc build  other than that the increase in core count and speed couple with gen 4 ssd and rtx 3090 ti everything else is just slow,negative

upgraded from a 9900k and had a hotter running pc couldnt figure it out at first and found myself checking my aio reapplying thermal paste checking settings etc after research i was able to discover that given it a slight undervolt helps what ended up helping even better and easier was ticking down the performance in the performance menu  in those option by simply ticking down the processor to 99 my temps went down to 55 for most of my games from initially running at average 8085 this tuning comes without a noticeable hit on fps except while playing squad a single core use cpu intensive game with that game i do lose at least 10 fps by having the processor at 99 this is not that big of a deal as i can easily tick it up to 100 for squad and just put up with the 7580 temps  happy that i can at least play most of my games at a good temp while gaining good performance by this upgrade,positive

this was intels top line cpu in the 11th generation it used the lga1200 socket which was only minimally different from the lga1151 socket 1200 pins vs 1151 pins the motherboards for the lga1200 required only small changes in production spec and the coolers made for the 1151 chips work perfectly on the lga1200 by contrast the 12th generation using the lga1700 socket required an extensive redesign of motherboards and the coolers that got adapted over from the lga 11511200 didnt really work properly on the 12th and 13 generation intel cpus this i911900k will pull about 170 watts through the socket at factory overclock 100 and thats right on the limit of safe operation for the vast majority of air or liquid coolers on the market today,positive

this lga 1200 cpu is robust and easy to overclock assuming your motherboard supports overclocking and your cpu cooler supports it the base 35 ghz can easily support overclocking to 5ghz i used the intel windows overclocking program and it was easy to do the cpu installs easily and runs well,positive

i had an i7 10700 that went kaput on me so i figured why not upgrade to the overclockable 11900k since it was only about 50 bucks more to the the fastest cpu my mobo can handle i did install water cooling because it does run warm but lets just say this my computer now works at warp 9975 with the i9 10900k a nvidia 306012gb and 128 gb ddr4 at 3200mhz on userbenchmark website the lowest score i got was a 104 for gaming ufo ranking i overclock it a lot and it holds up well and stays under 50c with the water cooling for me  1110 would recommend promote ahead of peers,positive
woulda given 5 starts but it didnt come in the blue box instead came in a cardboard box with a stock cpu fan that would never keep this thing cool for gamingand original packing doesnt come with a cpu fandont even know if its new or used so be aware you need an aio or a really good air cooler but cpuz is reading i911900k so thats good,positive

when i upgraded my desktop i decided to go intel core i9 this time all my previous build was a 6th generation core i7 6700k it ran fine but it wasnt up to running windows 11 so an upgrade was in order besides my old board was starting to fail i originally bought a 10th generation core i9 10 core but that cpu was junk there wasnt enough pcie lanes to support my drives and usb devices this is a limitation of 10th generation cpus not a limitation on the board my video card rtx 3070 took up most of the available pcie lanes which took out most of my drives so i went to the 11th generation i9 8 core instead very happy with it it solved all my pcie lane issues i am able to run all my devices and drives the cpu clocks at 53ghz stable i have water cooling installed i see zero problems with this chip its fast its stable im plenty happy with the upgrade the board is a msi meg z590 ace gold i have 64gb ddr4 3200,positive
a great processor for my pc to complete its upgrade highest compatible for my motherboard but even with watercooling it was running too hot my computer would need to shutdown swapped back to my i710700 with no issues  while my computer was running the i9 it made everything very optimized including being able to utilize my 4070 graphics card to its fullest i may get another one to try again heard these can vary slightly on production,positive

if seen too many of these new i9s and i7s put in b550 boards or anything with an lga 1200 slot and its a waste this is the newest of the new guys if you get this cpu do it proper if youre not gonna shoot for utilizing its capabilities then get a 10th gen and save money youre gonna need a new board water cool this thing gen 4 nvme drive new 30 series gpus cause they utilize gen 4 pcie slots heres a simple breakdown of a good starting point when getting this cpu  step 1 get an 11th gen processor this i9 if its in your budget step 2 get a motherboard with gen 4 pcie slots z590e was my go to step 3 obviously water cool this unlocked beauty cause itd be a shame not to get it to 53ghz done safely with corsairs h150i elite capellix hovers around 40s in degrees celsius step 4 get a gen 4 nvme solid slate drive might as well go samsung 980 pro for the 7000mbs reads step 5 enjoy windows booting and being able to start opening webpages and games within 5 seconds of pressing the power button and never waiting for anything to load ever again    this is the future ,positive
the seller did an amazing job the item came even sooner than expected the bad news is that i installed it in my previously flawless running machine the reason i upgraded from my current i910900k is that i wanted to enable the nvme2 40 on my ssd i already had the drive and a z590 motherboard so why not right i put the new i9 11900k in and it started and enabled the 40 on my nvme yay right literally with in a couple minutes i received a watchdog timeout error this is caused by cpu cores failing to communicate with each other i called intel tech support who was less than help full i updated all drivers and still didnt work i did notice my cpu temp was running over 100c odd because i have the best nactura cpu cooler they sell i decided to upgrade to a liquid cpu cooler and that brought my cpu temp down to around 85c that still didnt fix the time out errors i put my old cpu back and all is happy i ended up sending the i9 11900k back but at least my i9 10900k is nice and cool even at 45 overclock lol,positive
the tenth gen i9 is better than this one but i got it because my mobo needed it for the m2 slot to work that being said were talking about small performance differences in top of the line components so its not a big deal with this thing being 650 without a sale i would never buy it because i can get an i7 from the same gen or previous and it will be just as good i will say that the photo is deceptive it does not come in the package on the photo with the cool blue plastic box it will come in a cardboard box like any other cpu overall its still a great cpu and is a great upgrade from my previous i5 8600k but not the absolute best and not worth paying 600 for,positive
the 11th gen flagship i9 was a major step backwards in specs cpus with 8 cores and 16 threads have recently been reserved for i7 skus intel lastminute scaled this cpu back because of constraints with the older 14nm process  at launch this cpu was a terrible value as of now if you shop around you can find this cpu bundled with a z590 motherboard at a very fair price i got into mine for under 41000 with an itx motherboard this suddenly changes the 11900k to being an excellent value it works extremely well but remember that 12th and 13th gen intel i7i9 will blow this out of the water,positive
cpu is great not a bad deal if you are building a budget oriented high end pc performance is similar to the 10900k but has the pcie gen 4 support which is the only justification for this cpu existance this with a new z590 and depending if you already have ddr4 ram this is 13 the cost of a new 12th existence i will admit i am very disappointed in the box the nice fancy one pictured is not the one sent instead you will receive your processor in a small cardboard box with intel branding it should be make clear that the box in the picture will not be arriving in the description or by updating the imgages,positive
products operates as expected but they shipped this really oddly it was first shipped ups and stayed in a picked up status for 2 days then a day or so later delivered to usps sat in des moines ia for 4 days then it crawled to me well after predicted time dont ship this way its the worst way too ship also you shipped it in a thin bubble wrap bag should have been in a box its a fragile chip but thank you for a good working product with no issues as of yet,negative
as others stated it is not in the box being shown so the advertised product is not what you get  however the good thing is the box doesnt mean squat to how it runs just grabbed this to upgrade my system from a 10th gen i9 to this only difference really is faster pcie slots on my board this would depend on your board and opens up an additional nvme drive,positive
i purchased this cpu during one of amazons infrequent and shortlived major price reductions i paid 30199 for the cpu at the time when it was selling for 38999 i wanted pcie 40 and thunderbolt 40 and i was considering a 5900x but i found the amd x570 motherboard feature sets to be disappointing even at the high end anyway i usually buy intel processors although ive occasionally bought amd in the past i have a very good cooler master masterliquid ml360 cpu liquid cooler which keeps the temperatures reasonably cool i also bought an asus z590 maximus xiii hero motherboard everything is faster with this cpu and motherboard from storage to graphics,positive
having eight cores and hyperthreading makes for a very powerful processor this is a very good overkill processor that is to say if you get this youll outpace software for several years it also has onboard graphics so if youre buying this for rendering and just light computing youll be okay and wont have to buy a discrete graphics card like a geforce  that said this thing can sometimes get warm under heavy use so a cooler is recommended i use a liquid cooler but if youre not using it for heavy gaming you can get away with just a fan  overall 1010,positive
been using this cpu for about a year works great  seen some reviews about the box issue but i received mine in the official intel box,positive
the processor was delivered in just a cardboard box rather the official box shown in the listing but other than that it works just fine and is exactly what i wanted,positive
came in correct box and arrived earlier than expected works perfectly aswell,positive
this cpu is hot and i dont just mean fast it runs pretty hot even with liquid cooling but with the right mb cooling and ram i think 5ghz may be reachable pushing it but reachable,positive
so far im really liking this cpu i purchased it on prime day for 300 which imo isnt too bad compared to what it used to be and how expensive the 12 gen cpus are  paired it with the z590 asus strix e that i got for 200 on prime days its working out pretty well  also threw in the 3600 cl16 ram with it as this ram apparently runs well with it  overall im pretty happy with this purchase,positive
installed the i9 11900k in the asus prime z590p wifi6 with team group ddr4 3200 cl14 and asus rtx 2070 has this computer running less than a whisper of sound i mean even when the pc ramps up to 53ghz then you hear still a whisper from all fans you really need to pay attention to the pc to even notice any sound at all,positive
this cpu is fast for gaming but for some reason it was crashing i check everything on my rig to be compatible and it was put a different cpu and problems are gone am not sure if it was defective or what but other than the crashing out of nowhere with the one i had excellent cpu now lets see how it goes with the return will edit once everything is handled i had a little experience with amazon that i dnt wish to no body still waiting on that for few months already,positive
4 star because i didnt get the fancy box,neutral
good product except for freight charges being costly,positive
this cpu is fast really fast remove the power limits and let its boost algorithms take over and it will blow your socks off you will need a good aio or really beefy air cooler or obviously a custom loop i went with the cooler master masterliquid ml240 illusion ordered an extra 2 of the hallo fans and set it up in a pushpull and under stress test8ng it stays in the 80s with all power limits removed while gaming it is usually in the 50s and occasionally the 60s if it is really intense  it is a tad on the pricey end but you want almost the same performance for less grab the 11700k,positive
right now the best processors out there in a few months im sure there will be better ones remember we are always buying guaranteed to become obsolete components for our computers unless they became technically obsolete all the manufacturers would go out of business sorry its the way of the world,positive
i wish intel would end this upgrade or die philosophy it really makes me unhappy my moms cool with it tho,negative
it does not worth buying this cpu it is really expensive i would expect it to be a good performance and good quality cpu and has good service but it doesnt match my expectations it is broken 10 days after i used it my computer was certainly not able to open after i google the issues and take it to a computer store it seems like the cpu is broken and there are many defective merchandises in this product so far i am not happy but still can convince myself that i am just not lucky even i feel ridiculous about why such expensive items have so many defective products i tried to use the warranty to get a new one or fix it but intels customer service is ridiculous slow after we tell them the issue it has been a month and they are still verifying our information it took them 4 days to reply us and told us what info they need we sent them the information immediately it took another 4 days to tell us that one of the information is wrong we gave them the correct information immediately this time it took 10 days to tell us that purchase information is good but they need the account holder to authorize the warranty why do not you tell us this at beginning after this it has been several days and we still wait for the reply now i do not understand why it takes so many days to just verify the customer information should not this be done in 1 days or even 1 hour i understand it takes time to reply and communicate cross teams but it still takes too long time especially this is a high price item it should have proper quality and service for this price,positive
got this on sale for 46 off a couple weeks ago and it made such a fantastic performance increase from my i7 7700k paired it with a msi z590a pro series motherboard 32 gb ddr4 3200 mhz ram msi ventus 2x 3060 ti gpu and a cooler master 240l water cooling system and its been absolutely incredible,positive

runs flawlessly on default settings on this rog strix z590e it over clocks itself to 53ghz all core if you really need it paired it with a corsair h100i 240mm and it doesnt go above 65c during heavy gaming if youre going to overclock it i suggest a 360mm aio or custom loop,positive

ive had this cpu since april of 2022 and just the other day my pc would only start the fans and the lights in the pc after switching some parts and testing it turned out the cpu has gone bad it did perform well while it was working but for a cpu that was not overclocked or used for anything more than gaming it shouldnt go bad like this,negative

im getting bsods will not accept xmp profile just to run at stock the processor needs 17v i ran 3d mark cpu test cpu hit 109c at stock settings this listing is deceiving did not come in the box this cpu is an oem tray processor with no warranty the cpu displays very odd frequencies i feel scammed im returning it i wish amazoncom had better monitoring of what and how sellers are listing products,positive
i got lucky and managed to get the 9900ks for retail and its definitely the best cpu for gaming however if your doing video editing or workstation tasks with how much these are marked up now you could easily go 3rd gen amd ryzen 9 or even a lower end treadripper chip but for gaming this is still the best i also got lucky and hit the silicon lotto and got a golden chip that stable overclocks to 51 or 52 if you really want to push it but youll def need a mobo with beefy vrms to get there i paired it with a maximus xi extreme mobo rtx 2080ti founders and did a complete custom loop with dual 360rads one for cpu and one for gpu with all ekwb waterblocks overclocked with 64gb ram 3200mhz with stable xmp enabled i was able to run stress tests for 12 hours and never got above 70c on the cpu and 45on gpu this processor doesnt come with thermal paste or a cooler so id highly recommend going thermal grizzly or arctic mx4 thermal paste and some sort of watercooling and just note if you really want to get this stable at high clocks youll need a premium mobo that can deliver the power to the cpu and if your doing custom loop id recommend setting up the loop so the gpu doesnt go straight to the cpu and try to separate them for optimal temperatures got this for my gaming pc but think for my streaming and workstation machine ill be going ryzen 9 3950x,positive
this was the ks version so out the box it runs at 5ghz on all threads it is the same cpu in most ways as the regular k version i99900k but it is highly binned so only the best silicon is used for i99900k  it is a kind of silicon lottery guanrantee those who want 5ghz on all threads will get it with this model as everyone knows no two cpus are the same an i99900k not ks might be as good with overclocking but no way to know its possible that it will never go above rated speed if unlucky with the silicon lottery  negative point warrantee is only 1 year others are 3 years as overclocking voids warranty if any oc is detected the warranty of all chips is cancelled so it makes little difference to any overclocker  i wonder why 1 year though intel said because replacement stock is sold out quickly for this special version mmmmm also they know customers of this are likely to be enthusiast and oc can be hidden also the tdp is higher 95w regular this is 127w  the price increase is small so for me the only small downsidequestion is it it is by far the fasted 9th gen cpu out of the box many can be overclocked to 51ghz and with good cooling a lot will manage 52ghz the only enemy of 52ghz is heat make sure to have a good mobo with best vrms and use powerful cooking i use arctic 2 which is different thickness than othe aio standard for all compaies is 27mm this is deeper 34mm approx so check it fits lenghe is no issue arctic 2 was the best 280 aio available at time of purchase so i say strongly you must have strong cpu cooler this cpu generates an enormous amount of heat and is only viable with an above average water cooler thatt very important,positive
perfect way to end a gaming  rendering pc build is with a high powered processor that wont miss a beat the extra money spent over the 9900k is well worth knowing youd spend way more on sites like silicone lottery where you pay someone extra to get a cherry picked processor that will have the alpha performance most enthusiast are after ,positive

plain and simple get an aio cooler i ran the i99900ks at 51 ghz on noctua u12a at 66c full load 38c idle and it did a great job but i had to keep the case doors open the heat generated 80c was too much for the front case fans 3  120mm to move at 1800 rpms with the case doors closed  the i99900ks is outstanding im getting 130 fps on average with my evga 1080 ti and it rips through any video games i have i enabled the xmp profile on my memory to get 3200 mhz  the price point is crazy i bought the cpu after the initial sale in october 2019 sale and i paid a hefty price 62900 for it do i regret it  no  final thought  if youre on a price budget dont get in the overclocking game it will drain your wallet,positive

is it worth paying a premium for the guaranteed performance that you may or may not achieve with the 9900k i generally will hang on to a system for 35 years before doing a major upgrade so in my case knowing that i have the best of the best was important mine runs at 51 on all cores without breaking a sweat  its worth remembering that all the very best 9900ks will serve as the basis for the ks so your chances of receiving just a mediocre k will increase dramatically,positive
buyer beware when i installed this into my msi meg z390 godlike after getting it all built i powered it up and nothing this processor is new enough that when you install it on your motherboard you are very likely to not get any display and in my case now i have to actually take my computer to a shop so that they can give the board the bios update needed to get everything working the appeal of this processor running all cores at 5 ghz is salivating but im pretty disappointed that i never discovered this issue in the research i did before buying this it will be at least a week or two now where i have a large paper weight desktop computer and no running computer until i can get this fixed its likely that if i would have ordered a 9900k instead of the ks i wouldnt be having this issue,negative
got this cpu to have the best gaming cpu that is what i now have however i also love overclocking and benchmarking having paid for a binned cpu i feel i should easily hit 52ghz stable with an msi godlike mobo and ekwb custom water loop however going over 51ghz even with almost 14v power to cpu will not pass prime95 or intel burn stability tests guess maybe i failed the silicone lottery however it runs very stable at the 5ghz as advertised there are people hitting 52 on regular 9900k so i suggest save the few extra bucks and dont get the ks model,positive
i only had to change out there 9700k for this 9900ks and manually set my timings off my gskill 3600cl15 ive gotten to the point of overclocking processors that are already at their limits will net you nothing  glad i got it on release day,positive
overclocked on all cores to 52 without any problem also  the ks can run all 8 cores at that 52 at the same time  the k variant steps down the speed on all the cores after 1 so the guy saying he has overclocked his k version to 5 on all cores doesnt even understand his own chip,positive
nice to not have to mess with overclocking manual overclocking isnt hard to do but from my experiences can cause some games to bring up errors its nice to have the overclocked speeds and even some headroom to mess around if you want and the ease of plug and play,positive

this 10 generation intel package includes the fan so putting a system together is very easy i had the entire system working within 35 minutes of starting i added a 2tb solid state drive and 32 gb ram so performance from power on to power off is fantastic with a good high speed internet connection everything is faster and switching is instantaneous i spend very little time waiting for anything to load as well as significantly faster response on all applications including gaming apps even so most of the time half of the cores are idle or under 10  great processor,positive

i bought this thinking i was getting a 10900k this is not the k version this processor is a dog compared to the 10 900k  now i have a 400 fishing sinker  update  i turned off the power limits flys good now at 48 ghz all cores spikes to 51 low heat so i guess im happy with it  update  bumped my memory to 3600 and now i can get up to 52 ghz,positive
a very fast processor and actually much more cooler than my old i73770 even under the high load  i read all the reviews about it being hot and wattageconsuming this is simply not true with radeon rx 590 gpu noctua cooler my 760w psu never starts spinning its fans,positive

this started a new pc build for me when it was on sale for 320 i havent built a pc since 2007 so it has changed a bit since then this thing runs hot at full load watch gamers nexus on youtube it will pull a solid 250 watts running cinebench im using an arctic freezer 2 420mm with a thermal grizzly contact frame and kryonaut and it will load up to 80 degrees almost instantly without throttling but drop immediately to 2530 degrees when the load stops this is with ambient at 22 degrees  this thing is brutally fast though and in reality outside of load testing it i have rarely seen it go over 30 usage the more recent i5 and i7 processors can more or less be equal in most use cases i5 1314600 i7 1314700  this processor is still toptier and will be for a few years to come 12th gen iseries processors were a gamechanger the 13thgen improved on them a bit with more ecores and the 14thgen is looking like a stopgap to the next big thing  you wont be disappointed make sure to keep it cool,positive

this is essentially a 13700k that is 1 gen earlier but you dont have the issues of raptor lake and 14th gen raptor lake refresh becoming unstable and eventually dying 13th and 14th i7s and i9s from intel have been having stability issues yet 12th gen seems to run just fine without issues,positive

this has everything i wanted in a cpu lots of cores and threads for heavy editing and for gaming this might be the best gaming cpu i have had and some will till you it gets hot or uses a lot of wattage but i went in the bios and fine tuned it now even with it running 100 i never go above 80c and my last cinebench score was over 28000 not bad for a 34800 cpu i do recommend this i dont think you will be unhappy and it will give you many years of servicepsi also recommend using an anti bending plate good luck,positive
the box is different than what it say on amazon picture but it is the original,positive
amazing cpu for my gaming rig the price quality is just right and not insane compare to the 13th gen i9 this cpu is future proof for the next 57 years definitely a steal for its price in today market,positive
i ended up returning the product because it the delivery date was late 3 different times and i needed the processor at the original delivery date the item was shipped late and then the delivery was delayed 2 different times and the processor was in the smaller box and not the package in the picture  it was the correct processor and the price for it was fair but some people rely on that delivery date sometimes,positive
this beast of a cpu arrived on time and was well packaged i bought this for a new gaming monster of a computer  pros easy to mount my cpu with little to no over clocking runs at 35ghz with some fine tuning it can run stability at 57ghz on all cores with efficiency cores running at 38ghz awesome  cons pricey considering the 13th generation is only 120 more dollars than this at the time of purchase ran into some issues with the cpu being recognized but with a bios update fixed no other problems that i can find if i find any i will update this review  overall i think this cpu is an awesome one it has definitely has made my build a beast of a machine i recommend this to anyone that doesnt want to upgrade to intels 13th generation cpus,positive
i came from an amd 2990wx build that while it was good and stable always had some quirks about it that just annoyed the crap out of me at best while this probably cant multithread to the same degree it does represent a lot of power and speed 52ghz across 8 cores  16 threads on an air cooler and im not touching anything for ocits great as it is even the slow cores clock in upwards of 4ghz which the tr tapped out at best with 42 and that was only for a couple coresworth  this one on air does back off that max clock not soon afterwards but i also have this in a 4u rack mounted case with 4 chassis fans vs the previous build which was on a 360 radiatoraio and had 13 system fans but i was going for a rather ridiculous build with that vs this build im going for subtlesleeper  that this system runs as fast as it does with as little fan noise on airis something rather amazing,positive
this processor is a monster if you dont want to have to worry about buying a cpu for a few years this is the one most games i play this thing is chillin at 15 cpu usage a robust cooler is a must this processor has a lot of cores personally i use the noctua nhd15 cooler and it does a phenomenal job of keeping this cpu cool i highly recommend installing intels xtu program which will allow you to manage the cpu in many ways good cpu,positive
this cpu rips i heard people complain that it runs hot but with some really good thermal paste and the nzxt kraken this thing doesnt see anything passed 75c on a heavy load definitely recommend,positive
the various letters at the end of the intel processor can indicate several things k processors are unlocked and can be overclocked and there are 1214 versions indicating their use or level of processing this is a ks which is unlocked and what they call a special edition each processor intel produces is tested before shipment and when its abilities are tested as above average it is given the s designation this means it has that little extra ability to process the processors that test lower may be used for other applications andor the graphics ability is turned off anyway the ks can be thought of as the best processor especially for gaming and it normally will cost a little more than the other varieties,positive

as a long time computer user that wants the option to do everything  coding gaming audiovideo editing i hadnt upgraded since i bought my 3rd gen processor almost a decade ago for various reasons my only option was the i912900ks and the cooling issues that everyone mentions concerned me greatly stability is essential for my requirements  with a strix lc ii 360 cooler on idle using the preapplied cooling paste im experiencing semiidle temps of 24c when gaming ive not exceeded 78c not a great deal of data there but an example of my experience so far if it changes ill amend this review accordingly,positive

i would prefer this processor over ryzen 5 3600 because now r5 3600 is freeking over priced  and i5 10400f has high single core performance than r5 3600  so over all price to performance ratio is much better of i5 10400f than r5 3600 now amd is selling overpriced processors so right now intel is better option because no one is looking intel and everyone is just buying amd because of this many amd prosessors are out of stock and overpriced right now so go with intel and neither im intel fan boy nor amd i am just a custmor  which company provide me better performance with nice pricing i would go with that company,positive
at the current price of about 15800 there is no point of buying 10400f because the regular 10400 is available at a cheaper price of 15600 the price for 10400f should not be over 13500 inr  about cpu  today when prices for computer parts are super inflated this processor is a life saver if you find it at reasonable price the performance in games is at par with core i5 10600 it only lags slightly behind in productivity but makes up for that at price if you are on a budget and want to build a versatile system that can last you for next 3 to 4 years look no further,positive
i got this cpu  motherboard combo at 19500 cpu i5 10400f motherboard asus prime h410m e so this cpu wrecks every single cpus available at price of 18000 to 10000 rupees it has base speed of 29ghz and its one core can boost upto 43ghz and all cores together can run on 401ghz in terms of gaming performance this cpu beats ryzen 5 3600 at non oc turbo speed  only issue is its bundled cooler it is just crap i used coolermaster hyper 212 with my i5  and totally satisfied with its performance,negative

lets start with the seller outstanding amazon advertised a 2 day delivery if i ordered within 2 hours i did but the order defaulted to a week delivery i contacted the seller who promptly upgraded my delivery for free and it arrived in excellent condition exactly as the seller promised superb service thank you  the item brand new and sealed as you expect to see if you purchased from a physical store simple and easy to install the chip which was automatically detected by the pc and the improvement was immediately noticeable  the cooling assembly looks the part with a larger heat sink area compared to the old cpu but sadly the mount was incompatible with my motherboard so i had to revert to using the old heat sink seems to be fine so far but ill keep an eye on it the reason for the incompatibility is my original mounting is achieved using 4 springmounted philips screws but the new cooler is supplied with plastic press studs that were too wide to insert into the threaded holes  the new cooler comes with the thermal paste preapplied so simply a case of scraping it off with a knife and spreading it onto the old heat sink shame as the intel cooler assembly looks a lot cooler excuse the pun than the standard dell one but this is no fault of the seller,positive

was able to snag this for about 150 before taxes on a random flash sale and used it to upgrade my home theater pc which i mainly use for vr and more casual titles at 4k in my living room  for me this replaced an aging i76700k the performance uplift is night and day between the two and this would make a fine chip for any new gaming pc you might put together today please note that the f variant does not have integrated graphics but if you already have a gpu then this wont matter for you this is only 6 cores 12 threads as well being an 11th generation chip from intel theres no performance vs efficiency core debate here 6 cores is what you get  one word of caution is that as i write this review this cpu is currently listed for 199 which is about the most id recommend paying for this cpu the 150 price i paid was fantastic of course but its not something i would rely on getting again even with black fridaycyber monday coming soon a newer i512400 will offer similar levels of performance for roughly the same or potentially less money though that isnt overclockable a 12600k would blow this out of the water but youre looking at a far more expensive cpu the ryzen 5600 or 5600x are also great foils for this cpu especially if they can be had for a cheaper price the amd chips also have the advantage of cheaper motherboards for that generation compared to the intel chips at the moment  end of the day if you can get this for a good price go for it but this wasnt the absolute greatest even for its time and newer chips can sometimes be had for a better price,positive

if you have a gpu anyway then this presents great value for the price benchmarks are 510 better than ryzen 3400g which is at the same price range ryzen 3600 on the other hand performs 1012 better than this gpu while costing 50 more i didnt quite see the value there  keep in mind that this wont work without a dedicated graphics card if you do not have a gpu or if you are planning to get one after a while go for ryzen 3400g out of the box it has pretty good onboard graphics even better if you can buy 3600  the other thing to note is the motherboard intel series 300 chipset is a must here ok so even if you save some money with the cpu the motherboards are pretty expensive odds are youd be spending the same if you go for 3600g which is better and has on board graphics with a cheaper motherboard,positive

if you are upgrading your old pc then go for it it is the best processor for budget up to 15000 pair it with atleast b360 chipset motherboard or above dont use b310 motherboard its for pentium processor it is better processor than amds processor up to 18000 if you have a budget of 20000 make sure to go with intel i5 9600k for 1080p gaming pair it with atleast gtx 1660ti and 3000mhz ram 1650 ti and 1660 is also reasonable choice at slightly less performance pros best processor of its class it can beat most of amd ryzen 5 processor powerfull and good for beginner gaming as well as for smoothly day to day uses cons it must need a graphic card for display doesnt support 3000mhz and above ram it supports 2666mhz ram 3000mhz ram works fine at 2666mhz  over clocking can be done only in atleast z370or above board overall very good processor for budget gamer and streamers for trend of pubg mobile as well as pubg pc pair it with atleast b360m gaming and above motherboard ram must be 2666mhz or above 3000mhz works fine graphic card  nvidia 1050ti 1650tigood1660better 1660tibest,positive

very good entry level gaming processor just dump the stock cooler if you dont even want the processor to hit 70degrees  any hyper cooler or any other cooler should bring the max temperature down by another 20 degrees seems the stock cooler is just for namesake definitely vfm,positive

very good but first check other processors at this range compare if 2 to 3k difference with other cpus at high performance you can get that,positive
im really happy with my purchase so far i can play all my favourite games without any problems and got a nice cpu benchmark score too i just wish that the price was a little bit lower i feel that its just a little bit higher than it should be,positive
when intel released i5 9th gen series market values were high 9400f also had same value as 9400 now as its value came down its a great competition to ryzen5 2600 if you also plan for a solid dedicated gpu just go for 9400f,positive

if you would be building pc just for gaming and slight editing or coding here and there this is perfect and the cost is really low considering what performance it gives this cpu is by no means a low end cpu dont go gentle with that price the intel 12100f can easily handle gpus upto gtx3060 or rx6800 just go for it and say no to ryzen in this price for gaming,positive
this is one of the best cpu in budget if you only looking for gaming for productivity it not worth buying then you should go for i5 12400f but for gaming and light cpu workload it work like butter smooth i have teated some games in it  you can check it on my yt channel r tech studio,positive

coming from i5 4460 after installing ssd i can say that there is little improvement in gaming not a surprising difference from 2x more costlier processor though i5 4460 bottlenecked gtx 1060 3gb 9600k managed to fully match with both gtx1060 and 1660 super installed a week ago however i was not able to play or install any games as something is causing games to either crash crashed without an error from steam or downloaded one getting a ram error investigation in progress even windows 10 version needed an update to support graphics card driver i do not wish to overclock this processor but will update the actual performance after fixing the ram issue installed basic coolermaster heat rs 1800  update the new ram card was causing the games to crash after replacing from amazon all games running in desired settings with no issues blindly go for it instead of amd or older i7,negative
the stock speed of this processor is 37ghz the all core turbo boost frequency is 43ghz but single core max turbo frequency is 46ghz  i did some overclocking and from my experience the cpu is running well at 4870ghz all core speed you can see in my attached image this configuration outperforms the i77700k by 20 more  this is a reasonable processor since im cooling it with a 120mm radiator the processor usually runs at 44degree celcius after an hour of stress testing it is constantly running at 80degree celsius  this processor does not include the usual intel air cooler you need to purchase one  the seller is also a good seller on amazon the delivery is good the package is sealed and the product is genuine before confirming the order the seller contacted me and asked about my experience is system assembling and once i gave them the assurance that i can build a system and i know the hardware then only they shipped it,positive

i have been building my own gaming pcs since 2011 in an effort to save a few  i opt to use the i5 vs the i7 and go for a higher end graphics card while this may not be the optimal choice for most gamers it has been a good working strategy for me  the gaming pcs i have built have been serviceable for as long as 5 years with my last one retired utilizing an i5 3570k which my wife had been using when i upgraded my system in 2017 toan i5 7600k both of these sysytems rocked gaming for me never a problem glitch slowing of frame rates etc  when the 3570k system started having some motherboard issues i rebuilt a pc for my wife integrating the bulk of my 2017 i5 7600k build into it she has a blazing fast pc and is quite content with it  filling the void i built my current system with the core i5 9600k using a 1tb nvme m2 pcie gen3x4 ssd as the main drive and a samsung 1tb evo ssd for secondary this is the fastest pc i have ever owned with remarkably fast boot up and loading speads the m2 ssd makes boot time from the appearance of the bios screen to windows between 42 seconds the fastest and 48 seconds being the slowestremarkable  gameplay is fantastic i mostly play fps  3rd person shooters and a few other type games like the tomb raider series it may of course be my imagination but evrything appears to be faster more sharp and extremely fluid i sold on this cpu  i would definitely recommend it  pros everything  cons none,positive

amazing processor using a 1660 and was previously using an i5 3570 bought this and my system has never been faster ive gotten almost double the performance in nearly every game tiny exaggeration 6c6t is perfect for gaming the cpu does well in other applications too like premiere photoshop blender etc if your motherboard supports overclocking it makes this processor even better it ran at 43ghz at stock but i managed to bump it to 5ghz on all cores just a note stock runs extremely fine as it is but ocing will give a bit of a performance boost and if you oc right it can provide extra stability i dont really need the extra performance though  using this cpu with the kraken x63 i get around 50c while gaming so there are no problems in temps  1660 6gb  i5 9600k has less than 1 bottleneck the perfect combo so this cpu works amazingly i recommend this to anyone its awesome dont hesitate to get this,positive

got this little guy ocd to 5ghz stable at 134v doing some research it seems like anything over 14 can shorten the lifespan and it handles anything i can throw at it gamingwise pulls 60fps in emulators like cemu and rpcs3 no problem heat dispersion is amazing not even using a watercooled setup i literally slapped my old hyper 212 evo on this thing with a tube of 10 year old artic silver 5 and 6 months later it still doesnt go above 70c even when stress testing and doesnt even hit 60 at normal load when gaming video rendering is solid too but if you are really big on that you could probably do better with the extra cores of an i7 or i9 but if youre mostly just looking to play games then this baby will serve you well for a very long time at a great value,positive

ive had like all my friends tell me this wasnt going to work though i may upgrade in due time still they were all wrong all these kids who played xbox then bought a prebuilt pc and thought that a i7 is better than i5 because of a two number difference xd i can run battlefront ii maxed ultra settings anti aliasing and the whole nine yards turned on in nvidia cp i dont optimize it in geforce exp either with the wrong settings it helps sort you out but if you have good settings with good performance itll just weigh you downi have preferences set to in game for most of the nvidia cp but theyre high asf i mean this thing isnt cranked to 100 but dayum it delivers mind you this is all on hdr10 50 television xd i know i need a monitor its coming btw i get a solid 4060 frames 30 in ery intense situations thats because i need a better monitor lol this thing is 120hz for tv but its not your standard 165hz monitor which i require anyways shes a beaut and barely hits 100 in extreme situations like currently my cpu is at 1015 usage gpu is at 1520 vram at 44 and ram at 37 with like 7 programs running in game my gpu maxes 100 thats normal guys lol vram will be like 6070 tops 9095 on insane games with the ram constantly following at arounf 715 behind it and the cpu maintains a strong 80 with quality and performance high and well even at 100 on space engineers it handles fine frames and all but i dont wanna push her thats why i disable any extreme performance overrides in my motherboards software manager sony vegas btw this thing handles flawlessly for editing with right settings just disable extreme performance from your motherboards software manager and turn it to a balance setting and also shes very quiet with right cooling installed i myself have a water cooler and 14 fans for internal conclusion budget built bold beautiful no this is not a mascara commercial this thing is just good,positive

went from an old presoldered quad core amd apu to this so as one can imagine this was quite the upgrade it is so nice having a six core cpu i can see the benefit of having more than six cores for most games as well as any video editing and rendering i do i have this pared with a rtx 2060 super back before gpu prices skyrocketed and i think it was a good pairing of what id think of as a mid range cpu with a mid range gpu as for buying this during the gpu shortage at least from my experiences using the in built graphics on this is passable using this can be used fine for video watching and class productivity as i used the inbuilt graphics on this in a vm i needed for specific software needed for my classes,positive

intel does one thing really well all the time and that single core performance the i5 has a super crazy high clock speed with turbo or manual overclocking so for 200 you can really get a lot out of this chip in my experience mainly using this chip as a workstation cpu i find that its a little lackluster especially for 4k video editing but thats just due to the nature of it being a more or less budget cpu if you want the best bang for the buck then the amd ryzen 57 line can be had for a lesser price or same price for a ryzen 7 and you will have much better threading performance which is very useful for video editing and rendering  as a gaming pc this thing rang swbf2 at ultra setting without a hiccup thanks to a beast graphics card so no complaints as a casual gaming chip  overall if you are not buying a motherboard that can over clock this cpu youre wasting your money the i5 shines when you start boosting it especially for gaming and tasks that dont require multiple cores for optimized usage be warned it does run a little hot because of its high voltage and the fans will start spinning fast early be sure to buy a silent fan or dont go cheap on water coolers with cheap fans,positive
sin duda este procesador al ser serie k brinda ms ventajas en cuanto a overclock y en cuestin de juegos tiene el desempeo suficiente para poder jugar en una gama mediaalta no se necesita tener un procesador muy potente para jugar a 4k en ese caso conviene invertir ms en una tarjeta grfica ms potente  algo necesario que hay que saber es que se menciona que tiene una frecuencia turbo de 46 ghz pero esta es la frecuencia mxima por un solo ncleo se podra lograr alcanzar esta frecuencia con un poco de overclock pero hay que considerar tener un disipador medianamente eficiente para esa tarea ya que la frecuencia mxima por los 6 ncleos es de 43 ghz,neutral

ho una gtx 1070ti che prima avevo accoppiato con un i5 7500 pensando fosse abbastanza per giocare in fullhd ma mi sono dovuto ricredere quando ho fatto lupgrade con questo processore il 7500 faceva bottleneck a volte poco a volte davvero tanto per esempio su cod mw ottenevo tra i 90 e i 120 fps da quando ho messo il 9600k sto quasi sempre sopra i 144 fps mentre in warzone non mi scende sotto i 120 su rainbow six ancora meglio tutto maxato non scende mai sotto i 144 fps  quasi come aver cambiato pure scheda video ed  fantastico per maxare il full hd  il processore giusto su cui puntare il prezzo  giusto si riesce a fare un pc da 1000 per giocare a qualsiasi titolo maxato senza problemi si pu anche puntare su ryzen magari risparmiando qualcosa il problema  che il ryzen necessita di ram minimo a 3000 mhz per funzionare al meglio ci sono anche 40 fps di differenza tra le varie ram quindi se non volete cambiare la ram meglio intel e andate tranquilli,positive

 esattamente come ci si aspetta che sia ovviamente il cambio generazionale si sente se venite da un i5 6xxx 7xxx da quad core si passa a six core i 5ghz sono semplicissimi da raggiungere non richiedomo molto smanettamento ma ovviamente va abbinato un buon dissipatore specialmente per il calore generato dai carichi avx nel mio caso cryorig a40 e z390 gaming x e 5ghz stabili a 1290v  parliamo chiaramente con ryzen andreste sicuramente a risparmiare con una perdita di pochi fps nel caso il gaming sia il vostro scopo ma la necessit di ram pi performanti per ottenere il massimo da amd andrebbe a bilanciare fondamentalmente il risparmio anche se i prezzi delle ram stanno decisamente tornando ad un livello accettabile  a mio avviso  un ottima scelta sicuramente non lascia delusi assolutamente inutile il suo acquisto se non abbinato ad una scheda video degna puntate ad una 2070 o 2080 altrimenti tuffatevi su ryzen e investite il risparmio in una scheda video decente,neutral

i was really debating for a long time whether to go with intel or amd i know that lately amd offers skus with very strong capabilities and good price points that made my decision making process very complicated in reality many of us do not need the workstation horsepower of the amd ryzen or the i9 9900k i surf the web day trade play needforspeed and hitman and this i5 9600k is so good i overclocked it to 51 and 52 run the cinnebench r15 and r20 and the system is stable the max uncore i achieved is 48 it does not go higher than that for 52 mhz i have to increase the power in order to be stable i have not crashed it on 50 and 51 mhz but for 52 i have to play with the power settings i do not play multiplayer online games so i hear that this cpu is not good for that if you are thinking to play in such environment you should either opt for i7 9700k i9 9900k i still think that amds zen 1 and zen 2 are very good cpus and their price point is way better than intel so it is difficult to choose one i know that amd requires more expensive ram modules but you can go with a cheaper b450 mother board so you can build an overall better machine for the money on the other hand i use very specialized software and i do not want to run into optimization issues if you ask me whether i would buy this cpu again my answer is i need to check my ego first which is bigger than i want it to be in reality this cpu is way above for what i need it my system is about 60 faster than my 4th i7 cpu,positive

really great cpu overall bought this to replace a i5 6600k so it was a relatively big upgrade was about 3540 increase in performance on standard clock but this chip overclocked pretty easily got it running at 5ghz on all cores at 1372v doesnt ever touch above 80c unless running harsh avx stress tests such as prime 95 all other stress tests sit 75c which im happy with gaming it normally sits around 65c this cpu is paired with a corsair h110igt cooler 3200mhz ddr4 ram and a msi z390apro gaming  the gaming performance is really good in this chip like really good there is only a 5 difference between the 9600k9700k and 9900k according to a lot of benchmarks so for the price point this cpu is superior to its competitors amd cant compete at this price point for gaming performance  theyll suffer a 1015 loss compared to the i5 due to their lower singlecore performance especially when overclocked i play most newer games at 1080p max settings and get around 60fps for some games such as overwatch i get a solid 150fps this is capped for my monitor this is paired with a gtx 1070 btw and these two components dont bottleneck each other at all,positive

i bought this because it was slight cheaper as an amazon used item and in stock as currently the new intel 9th gen are really in demand overclocked to 5ghz on 2 cores 48 on 4 46 on all cores with no voltage increase just left on auto seems to be at 124v runs relatively cool on an old evo 212 cheap tower cooler it is a hackintosh so being thermally limited is what apple would do lol im sure prime95 avx would cook it in seconds but normal software doesnt seem to be a problem overclocking is playing the lottery but the solder used to attach the heat spreader in these new chips is worth getting the 9th ben over the previous crap intel has been selling my previous cpu a 3770k did not cool as fast as this thing having the thermal past instead of solder really does make a difference in intel powe gadget when you shut down prime95 there is a cliff on the termperture chart that is immediate the temperature drop is so sudden i worry about things cracking  the intel power gadget reports about 130 watts with all cores using prime95 without avx the 95 watt tdp is bs you will have to go in the bios and change the 95 in about half a zone places annoying dont overlook changing the max current too if you are not getting the speeds you think you should that is probably what is wrong  so far not a single crash but im happy with 2 cores at 5ghz a little extra just to feel special,positive

da ich einen neuen computer zusammenstellen wollte fiel meine wahl relativ schnell auf den intel core i5 da ich wirklich nur ein mittelklasse system wollte und ich bisher nie groe probleme mit intel prozessoren hatte mir ist es durchaus bewusst gewesen dass es mit der amd ryzen familie eine ernstzunehmende alternative gibt zumindest mti dem ryzen 5 3600 habe ich mich auch beschftigt jedoch habe ich mich doch wieder fr einen intel prozessor entschieden letztendlich wre es vermutlich aber auch egal gewesen fr welchen prozessor ich mich entscheide  beim preisvergleich auf amazon ist mir dann relativ schnell aufgefallen dass der i5 9600k preislich nicht allzusehr von dem i5 9500 welchen ich ursprnglich verwenden wollte abgewichen ist war wenn ich mich recht erinnere zum zeitpunkt des kaufs sogar der i59600k gnstiger deswegen hab ich dann diesen prozessor gewhlt  die installation im mainboard klappte ohne probleme ich habe dann nur meine wahl auf das asus z390p angepasst da ich nicht zwangslufig bertakten mchte mir die mglichkeit moderat zu bertakten offenhalten wollte  wichtig zu wissen ist nur dass in der boxed version der prozessoren mit dem k im namen kein khler integriert ist da ich nicht so hufig prozessoren kaufe ist mir diese info anfangs entgangen was aber auch nicht schlimm ist weil man fr ca 25 schon khler findet welche ganz okay sind  bisher luft das system flssig und erledigt alle seine arbeiten zuverlssig und ohne probleme,positive

upgrading to the intel core i513600kf desktop processor from my ryzen 5800x3d has been a gamechanger for my computing experience this powerhouse of a processor with its 14 cores 6 pcores and 8 ecores and a substantial 24m cache has significantly enhanced the performance of my system the ability of this cpu to turbo up to 51 ghz is particularly impressive contributing to a remarkable improvement in processing speed and overall system responsiveness whether im running demanding applications engaging in highend gaming or juggling multiple tasks simultaneously the i513600kf handles it all with an ease that is immediately noticeable the efficiency and speed are especially evident in cpuintensive tasks where this processor clearly outshines its predecessor  beyond just raw performance what i appreciate about the intel core i513600kf is its balance between power and efficiency the division of performancecores and efficiencycores means that it smartly allocates resources based on the task at hand ensuring optimal performance without unnecessary power consumption this aspect is crucial for a balanced system thats powerful yet not overly taxing on energy use the upgrade process itself was straightforward and the compatibility with a wide range of motherboards and hardware made the transition smooth in terms of gaming the difference is palpable with smoother frame rates and faster loading times for creative tasks like video editing and 3d rendering the performance boost has been equally beneficial noticeably reducing the time spent on rendering and processing all in all the intel core i513600kf has proven to be an excellent upgrade from the ryzen 5800x3d offering a superb blend of performance efficiency and versatility its a 5star processor that id highly recommend to anyone looking to upgrade their system for an enhanced computing experience,positive

i wont go into much technical detail here since theres people a lot smarter than myself who can get into the nitty gritty generally speaking though  this cpu absolutely smokes especially for the price dont let the i5 name fool you the i513600k and kf is a topclass processor that for most users will offer more than enough performance for intensive tasks while having probably the most reasonable power consumption and cooling requirements of the topthree 13th generation intel processors  i came from an i75960x  still a solid processor in this day and age but unfortunately my motherboard wasnt exactly kind to me attempting to take it above 38 ghz despite it bottlenecking against my 2080 ti it still ran cool under a 360mm clc topping out at no more than 51 degrees c gaming gpu load and 60 degrees under full cpu loads but since the current market for new components is pretty good i opted to go all in on a 13th gen build rather than find a better x99 motherboard  odds are youre probably going to be cross shopping the i513600k with the i713700k and the i913900k unless your workflow necessitates the additional core count or youre chasing records the performance difference between those cpus and the 13600k did not seem worth the hundreds of dollars of additional cost and the massive increase in peak power consumption power also equals heat and that was another motivating factor for going with the 13600k having been accustomed to a relatively cool and quiet build for some time that said with the additional cores and much higher boost frequency i was expecting higher peak power draw and temps despite a lower tdp on paper  and they were definitely higher under the same 360mm clc after running benchmarks with cinebench and 3dmark i was hitting peak temps in the midtohigh 70s under full cpu loads gaming loads however were definitely more manageable though sitting in the 40s and seldom breaking 50 degrees which was actually a small but appreciable improvement over the 5960x id advise at minimum a high quality air cooler or a 240mm clc for this processor  the out of the box performance is something else though i managed to hit 23345 on a multicore cinebench test and a 16459 combined score on 3dmark time spy again this is stock clocks paired with an overclocked 2080 ti and 32gb of ddr5 at 5600 mhz at 3440 x 1440 and 144hz games run like butter i could dabble in overclocking it since i have the headroom but honestly i dont see the point its fantastic as is  all in all i feel like the 13600k is kind of the nobrainer option for most people looking to put together a highend system on a budget youre getting most of the performance of its more expensive stablemates for a much lower price and less obnoxiously high power and cooling requirements the kf is also a little cheaper if you dont need integrated graphics just buy it youll love it,positive

i was on the fence about upgrading from i5 12400f which is a beast of a cpu some pros and cons my specs rtx 4070ti z790 ddr5 gigabyte mobo 32 gb fury ram 1tb wd black ssd gen 4  pros more cores noticeably faster in some areas like booting and some applications some triple a gpu bound games will get a noticeable fps boost not huge talking 310 at most cpu bound games emulators for me will get much better stability and cpu usage reduction  cons if you are looking for energy efficiency these 13th gen and higher chips are not it more cores means more energy draw for sure on triple a games the chip is using 2030 watts more electricity in emulators like rpcs3 its nearly double i went from 30 40 watt average to average 80 and in some instances spiked above 100 the good thing is emulators are much less gpu bound so the wattage balances out sort of  heat im running an aio lian li 360 galahad with the 12400f i was nearly always running at room temp my house gets lots of shade and stays coolcold so i was used to 22c range with the 13600k you will see a 10 degree increase even at idle emulators will get into the 60s while triple a games 40s and 50s with the 12400f my fan curve rarely ever triggered high fan speeds with the 13th gen you will definitely hear those fans work at load  side notes i tried the 13600k on two mobos z790 and 690 you can use it on older 690 compatible mobos you just need to flash bios to latest it was super easy on the gigabyte z790 and 690 mobo  overall the performance jump is noticeable in some games but far more noticeable is the increase in heat and wattage usage if you have a 12th gen and are on the fence you really dont need to upgrade however depending on what you are doing with it could be the main factor i wanted my rpcs3 to run at 60fps in 4k constantly and the 13600k did the trick playing mgs4 guns of the patriots in 4k and stable is unreal,positive

literally runs 53ghz on stock voltage settings i cant explain in any language known to man how well valued this cpu is i tried my heart out to find a ryzen that could even get close on the performance per dollar and i cant also the f without onboard graphics is a life hack for gamers like when do you not have a dedicated gpu plus the f silicone has been proven to be more consistent in testing over the plain k,positive
been using this cpu for about a year now and its amazing for every game i play some of which are known to be cpu intnesive it has only gotten up to about 30 usage sure it is not a cheap cpu but it definetly has the processing power despite being an i5 even when i have stress tested it to 100 usage it still easily stays cool with a vetroo v5 cooler plus you can brag to people that your cpu has 14 cores and 20 logical processors great cpu would recommend,positive
i will always say intel is and always will be king of cpus for home or office use they have been in the game so long and always have done so well that i always recommend them although their rival does an amazing job as well but you cant beat their dependability and versatility in all aspects of pc use especially if you catch something like a 12600k for under 200,positive

this i5kf replaces my 11th gen i7kf sure one reads that and first thought is hes downgrading well hang on grasshopper this pup puts the 11th gen i7 to shame even when it was slightly overclocked very weird cause its has a slower speed but when its time to rock  roll it flies  boot time and app loading is measurably quicker when stressload tested using the intel tool it gets very hot with this processor temps above 89c did not cause throttling so intel must be ok with this temps are considerably lower when not testing i was ready to buy an aio cooler but am holding off for now the huge noctua d15 attached may suffice i dont want to mess around with water pumps so until intel figures out how to bring the heat with less heat i can park here for the foreseeable  lemme go out on a limb and say that for most folks this much hp may be overkill lastly this was not a vine purchase but a damn good one at 285,positive

cpu has really shown itself to be an amazing upgrade for me and is definitely one thing you can add to any build with a lga 1700 motherboard it punches far above its weight for the price and actually brought me back to intel after years of using amd products definitely consider it if youre going to build a cheap but effective build with this your gpu will be the bottleneck for sure,positive

ho trovato questo processore ottimo soprattutto nellambito da me pi utilizzato il gaming riesce tranquillamente ad interfacciarsi benissimo con schede video come la 1060 1050ti e anche rx 480 e 580 le temperature con il dissipatore e la pasta termica fornita con esso sono molto buone anche dopo un utilizzo prolungato sotto stress non si superano mai i 4647 gradi e con un dissipatore aftermarket si riesce a fare anche di meglio sempre che lo stesso valga pi di 1520 al disotto di questa soglia non vale la pena di sostituire il dissipatore stock non teme particolarmente il confronto con ryzen 5 anche perch per un utilizzo gaming lhypertrading di ryzen 5 risulta poco sfruttabile e non dimentichiamoci che questo i5  dotato di scheda video integrata al contrario di ryzen 5 rendendolo utilizzabile anche senza una gpu esterna consigliato a gamer per il full hd specialmente ed anche per un utilizzo lavorativo non produttivo non montaggio video o rendering per i quali un i7  pi consigliato,positive

had this for about 2 weeks and is brilliant managed to get it up to 55ghz on a asus z490 the only downside to this chip is that its very very hot with a double rad aio at 51ghz i hit 90c max and idle around 35c but upgraded to a full custom loop and now it has all the cooling it needs and it actually out preforms the i9 at 54ghz so keep that in mind for you overclockers all in all brilliant value and performance and the perfect match for my fe 3080 the only problem was delivery it came very dinged up and left in the damp,positive
dont let the 125w tdp fool ya because this chip runs way cooler than previous gens tested temps using occt stress test for about 3 hours alongside my noctua nhd15 cooler the highest ive seen the temp spike up to was 71c note that occt is a heavy synthetic test that pushes the cpu to the limit regular gaming temps will never reach that high ive had the chip for almost two months now and accumulated quite a bit of gaming hours during that time the games i played included a mix of intensive aaa titles like cod warzone and ac odyssey to light esport ones such as rocket league and rainbow six siege highest temps are always in the 50s to mid 60s range that is a huge difference compared to my old i5 6600k that spiked to over 80c at times my brother who bought a 9900k last year was also amazed by how much cooler 10th gen runs and even said that he wished he waited a bit longer before upgrading note that both the 9900k and 6600k have lower tdps than the 10700k yet still run warmer the reason as to why 10th gen runs cooler is because intel made modifications to the ihs of the cpu and upgraded their thermal interface material other then the improvement in the temperature department ive also noticed a big difference in gaming performance despite having a 2080 super my pc used to struggle to reach and stay at a consistent 100fps at 1080p cpu intensive games like ac odyssey often dropped to like 50fps this is a clear indication that there was bottleneck on the cpu side with this new 10700k my pc now has no problems reaching and maintaining that sweet consistent 144 fps on light competitive esport titles and 100fps on demanding cpu intensive aaa titles also note that i am running the cpu at stock settings right out the box and have not messed with overclocking yet nonetheless i am very satisfied with this cpu and i highly recommend it,positive

works great the original one i got from amazon died on me within 2 weeks it was essentially dead on arrival this rarely happens but from time to time this can happen  i contacted intel and asked for a replacement and they agreed as it was under warranty obviously while i had to pay like 10 to ship it to them which i originally thought was sorta cheap since other companies like msi cover the shipping costs i can see why intel doesnt  while i only paid 10 for shipping i assumed it would be ground shipping from canada to the middle of the usa and figured id be without a cpu for up to 2weeks  turns out intel ships via air and my package was on a plane and arrived at the facility within 8 hours and i had a new cpu in my computer within 72 hours  i would highly recommend this product even after my issues because intel was as fast as possible with replacing mine  after using this product for a few months its worked great and performs perfectly and ive had no issues since getting the original replaced,positive
i waited too long to switch back to the fps king this chip is amazing i missed you intel  the pc world is weird always chasing 50 savings too many games have cpu bottlenecks i debated hard between just buying a 3700x to replace my 2700x versus the hard mbcpu upgrade to intel but amd had left me frustrated my 2700x was never maxed out and i couldnt tell what was bottleknecking me the 3700x didnt promise much higher clock speeds so i wasnt sure if an upgrade would help i play rust on 1440p and my gpu and cpu would sit at 60 utilization or less with frames only around 70fps first test with the 10700k stock and im at 135fps max graphic settings my gpu is now pumping out 99 utilization and the game feels amazing  this chip runs cool on stock idk where all the bad thermal predictions came from but it didnt happen havent even ocd it yet and honestly i may not need to until i upgrade off of my 2080super but thats not happening any time soon im hitting 144fps on 1440p max settings now in every fps game and that was the goal  thank you intel you nailed this one the 9th gen had some costheat issues and that made me give amd a try and im glad to be back  for anyone choosing a card the 10700k is the sweet spot for gaming and streaming if you only game i think the 10600k is a cheaper but same performance i dont see any need for the 10900k,positive

this cpu has 38ghz base clock my old cpu had a boost clock of 38ghz and rarely reached it this cpu is perfect havent had any issue yet other than it does run a little hot but i have a huge cpu cooler so its only reaching high 60s on not hugely intensive games,positive
a considering its current price and given that its gaming performance without power limits is overall identical to the 11700k without power limits too and just 34 slower overall than the 5800x i would say this cpu is the best choice for gaming after overclocking it actually beats or matches the 5800x overall even when compared against a pboed 5800x by overall i mean when comparing these cpus in a large range of games 30 games and not just 45 something that some biased reviews do  b productivity is very good too although in heavy multithreaded applications eg tilebased rendering it does lose by 1020 to both the 11700k and the 5800x that said it reduces the deficit to only 315 in an overclocked vs overclocked battle thanks to its higher overclocking potential  c it runs pretty cool  i am using a noctua nhd15 and is also very silent even on stock auto motherboard settings and with power limits removed i dont get temps above 6869c even when running cinebench r23 in a loop and sustaining indefinitely the stock allcore 47ghz temps reduce further when you manually tune the voltage to a lower value a practice known as undervolting or when you apply a better thermal paste or a case with better airflow you can also undervolt and still overclock or overclock more without increasing the voltage above its stock value  d i paired it with a fairly highend asus z490 strixe board instead of a z590 one there is no reason buying a z590 board for 10th gen cpus as for the same price you typically dont get enthusiast features such as postcode third pcie x16 slot pcie bifurcation etc moreover most of the goodies of the z590 boards eg pcie4 additional m2 slot dmi3x8 are only enabled when using an 11th gen cpu so buying a z590 for 10th gen is a bit of a waste  e currently the price of the 11700k z590 is around 200 euros higher than that of the 10700kz490 combo if the difference drops to 6080 euros then i would advise to go for the former instead but as of now the 10700kz490 combo is the wiser choice,positive

i purchased this as an upgrade from my 1700x from a few years ago i wanted more performance but didnt want to lose the core count i had previously im getting anywhere from 2030 performance increase in every task including gaming i see a 47ghz boost often on all cores but never seen the advertised 51ghz on a single core yet regardless this is a great cpu and was worth the money for the performance boost over my previous platform,positive
in the my opinion the 10700k cpu is a great high end cpu from the intel lineup when bought at the discounted price they offer decent performance they are unlocked for overclocking and they still maintain the igpu for times when you might need it  i have bought many intel cpus in my time and i really like the 10700k due to its value for money factor  its not really worth going for the 11th gen at the moment while there arent much performance difference between them if you want to wait a bit longer then wait until 12th gen gets released and compare pricingperformance again if you need a cpu right now get it from amazon at the right price and youll be sorted,positive

i got this i7 because  a it was in stock b i had the budget for it c i trust intel more than amd ryzen even though amd ryzen is considered now as the better hardware judging by percore performance i have always thought intels drivers are better i have also heard recent reports that ryzen cpus usage can randomly go up by 20 with just the epic games store running i can imagine this will be fixed as it sounds more like some dodgy code than the hardware itself  on every game i have played i dont think the cpu usage has gone above 40 so this cpu will definitely last a long time before i upgrade  the 11th gen cpus will be in mass production soon so it may be worth waiting for that to come out or you could wait for the new ryzen cpus to come back in stock,positive

and a worthy upgrade to my gen 6 i7 although thats still pretty good too,positive
intel i7 procs are still priced a bit higher than they should be for these older 10 series but this is a good proc nonetheless,positive

while a good idea anyway with many processors now utilizing stock overclocks you can benefit a performance boost by choosing a better cpu cooler i went the cheap route actually i thought it was middle of the road since the thermaltake contac silent 12 is rated for 150w i thought i could get away with a 30 cooler since i am not planning on overclocking that cooler could not even keep up with stock cpu settings in benchmarks the cpu hit 80celsius in seconds and gradually up to 90 where i had it set to throttle in more practical testing under basic workloads the temps are more reasonable but the contac silent 12 has to ramp up to 100 fan speed frequently to keep that way and it is not quiet at that speed i know somebody is going to say thats because the default settings on the motherboard are overclocking the cpu beyond intels recommended settings well that was one of the first things i checked and thats not the case here despite what somebody on youtube said or didnt say not all motherboards do that it is a great processor and complements my workload nicely no games here the new cooler is a reeven justice 45 right now i has the same size 120mm fan however it has six heat pipes instead of four and the tower is about 50 thicker and fins stacked closer together temps while still pretty hot have come down 810 degrees on cinebench r20 it still gets up to 8082 celsius but instead of hitting 80 right away as it did before it takes until the render is almost complete and seems to level off there i feel better about the temps now that its not riding on the ceiling especially since all core full load is not a typical workload for me the fan is much quieter during typical use i would recommend that cooler for those who are looking for a good compatible cooler,positive
exactly whati paid for,positive
it feels pretty nice to double my core and thread counts with this cpu from the 6700k i currently have mine overclocked at 52ghz with a pushpull radiator liquid aio system and im maxing in the 70s as far as temperature goes definitely adds some fps to call of duty and control i havent tried red dead or gta v yet but since theyre usually so cpu bottlenecked im sure theyll run great with this  my config in case anyone wanted to know cpu 10700k cooler  corsair h105 mb gigabyte aorus z490 graphics rtx 2080 super ram  4 x 4gb ddr4 2 samsung 860s and 1 m2 870 id recommend picking up an m2 if you go with gigabytes now motherboards theyre putting 24 slots on their mbs now so i feel like its just untapped potential if youre not going to be using at least one of those slots power evga 750w 80 gold i think case  i did have everything in an nzxt s340 but i just moved it all into that new corsair mesh case that came out td500 mesh and airflow and aesthetics are superb,positive
seller is trash as he wont message you back when you want send it back,neutral
paired with a asus rog strix z490e gaming board i was able to easily and quickly achieve a 50ghz all core overclock on air cooling its rock solid stable with xmp profile on the ram and a small cache overclock this thing absolutely crushes my previous i77000k cpu and i noticed a big difference in fps in quite a few games  i think i may have gotten lucky on the silicon with this chip i can hit 51ghz stable but it does start to get a little too hot for my comfort but i actually dont start thermal throttling until i try 52ghz all core again this is just on air using a noctua dhd15 so its possible i could do more with an aio cooler with enough cooling and time spent tweaking this chip may very well hit 52ghz all core and remain stable ill update the review if i ever give that a shot  its expensive of course because its intel but if intel is your jam you cant go wrong here,positive
got the cpu on prime day for sale i didnt actually need the k variant because i dont plan on overclocking but it was actually cheaper than the f variant during the sale so far its been working wonderfully with no issues and i saved 127 big upgrade from an i54570 for gaming purposes this chip is probably a little overkill but it was so cheap i couldnt pass it up however since i had to change the mother board and all its components for it which all werent on sale i still ended up spending 670 for this chip debatable if it was really worth it but im happy with the performance,positive
zero issues installing and running it on a gigabyte vision g motherboard using a relatively cheap enermax 120mm liquid cooler and not overclocked the cpu idles around 30 deg c and under full load i have yet to have it go over 55 using a mid tower antec case with lots of airflow too of course anyone who is buying just a cpu is probably fully aware of what cooling issues they may or may not run into included my info just to help i got mine on sale but even at sale prices intel are never cheap i have never had an issue with any intel cpu i have used and if this cpu holds up like my old i73770k did i wont have to upgrade again for several years happy with the purchase,positive
i like the delivery being truly fast i messed up on the payment info and wasnt able to get it the same day like promised but amazon got it to me the next morning instead so that was nice and i appreciated the fact that they got it to me as fast as possible even though they probably could have just said no you didnt pay properly so no same day shipping so that was nice i will construct my pc once my motherboard comes in in sha allah so we will see if the processor is good,positive
i know this chip is on its way out but if youre looking at this and the price is right its a good cpu with a be quiet cooler my temps are good even under constant load one thing intel does that puts amd to shame is the integrated graphics especially right now when there are no graphics cards this will get you a working desktop i intended to upgrade to a ryzen 5800x from my ryzen 3600 later this year but my gtx 1070ti died and i was left with a broken desktop i opted to get this so i could work even if i couldnt play and the intel graphics makes the perfect fallback heck i could even play factorio and portal on my 3440x1440 monitor,positive
good cpu only thing is the seller doesnt say its a used product when i received the product the box was old looking with wear,positive
i have been a computer enthusiast for a while now i have owned several different platforms including both amd and intel i upgraded from a i7 7700k the 7700ks 4 cores and 8 threads started to show its age with the recent push for higher core counts i debated getting an amd 3900x the appeal of 10 cores and 20 threads was great and but at the sacrifice of core clocks i am a gamer at heart and do little videophoto editing the decision was made in my mind and i purchased the 10700k out of the box the 10700k boost to 51ghz yes 51ghz insanity while intel is still on a 14 nano meter architecture compared to amds 7 intel has refined the process to undoubtedly still beat amd in gaming i have no complaints about the 10700k it is satisfying to know i wont need to upgrade for years now,positive
i bought this along with the msi z490 unify as an upgrade from my ryzen 7 3700x this thing is an absolute monster that runs any game i throw at it at 144fps if my gpu can keep up its crazy people told me i wouldnt see many gains coming from ryzen but in some of my favorite games i was getting 60 higher framerates games perform amazingly well and i notice my loading screens all seem about 20 faster than my old chip as well everything is just smoother and faster theres less waiting time and i didnt have any bios issues or anything at all installation was easy honestly this is probably overkill unless you have a nice rtx graphics card but its a wonderful cpu the temps arent too crazy with a 280mm aio i think ill be happy with this chip for the next 5 years at least,positive
wouldve been better value when i bought them if intel didnt cut support for quicksync,positive
installation went smooth using this 10700k in a rig with a 2060 super and it is crushing fps numbers i mainly play fast paced shooters and want as many frames as possible and this thing does not disappoint came from a ryzen 3770x valorant and csgo frames are very high and i never get any slow downs or mouse input delay it feels great  also a lot of people said this new intel gen ran very hot and i dont even hit above 65c at full load having it overclocked to 52ghz now i do have one of the best air coolers out there so even if you have a cooler that is not as good you are looking at safe and normal temps even when overclocked to 52 ghz,positive
i love this processor granted its a huge upgrade over what i had previously but even with that in mind i still think this is an impressive unit the base clock of 38 is pretty fast already but under load with no tweaking it would reach and maintain 46 no problem and with windows performance power profiles it reaches 50 with ease and thats with no overclocking buyer beware this thing makes some heat so get yourself a good heatsink or deal with it underclocking a lot to keep temps under control,positive
i just got into pc building there are so many chipsets on the market after 100s of hours watching everyones favorite youtubers i learned one thing a lot of chips fit the specs for what you need lol i am extremely happy with this chip coupled with my asus mother board overclocking this thing was a breeze as far as temps when overclocking im able to keep this cool with a pretty standard cpu fan no need to watercool although the look of it is awesome,positive
put in an msi z470 sli  just finished so dont know about the gaming yet just know it runs superfast and super cool water cooled with a corsair 280mm radiator of course it is freezing in this room and we all should know it can never be cooler than the air around it,positive
i bought this to upgrade my gaming pc and without even running a gaming app i can already tell the speed is much better than my i76700k things that would require 50 of my processor utilization take less that 10 on my cpu load only big down side is you have to get a new motherboard for this type of socket lga1200 or something and it requires more power from your supply so make sure you have the equipment necessary before buying,positive
the i710700k is a fantastic cpu for the money i upgraded from a i54690 locked nonk and can immediately tell a difference in a lot of games i play my gpu evga rtx 2060 is not bottlenecked by the cpu anymore dont believe all the things you read about intel 10th gen chips running hot either i have this installed in an itx case with a noctua air cooler and idle temps are between 2831c load temps dont go above 60c it also reaches 51ghz out of the box no overclocking needed,positive
got this cpu as an upgrade from a i7 7700 during 2021 it has been a huge upgrade for gaming i have never overclocked it and has been used in a deepcool netwin rgb cooler the only downside for my unit is that it has reached high but still normal temperature 82 degrees celcius,positive
